Hi, my name is Mosh, and I'm going to be your instructor in this Python course. We're going to talk about all the core concepts in Python, and then we're going to build three Python projects together. In this course I'm going to teach you everything  you need to get started with Python. In this course, you're going to learn everything you need to get started programming in Python. You're also going to learn how to use Python in machine learning, or artificial intelligence. You will write a Python program that will process thousands of spreadsheets in under a second. You can write your first Python program in literally seconds. So you will learn how to write a Python programming that will predict the music that people like based on their profile. I've designed this Python course for anyone who wants to learn Python. I'm super excited to be teaching you Python in this course. In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to download  and install Python on your computer. So let's go ahead and download Python 3, alright now,  look at your downloads folder, here, we should have Python 3 installer simply double click that, if you're on Windows  you're going On this page click on downloads,  here you can see the latest version of Python currently, at the time of recording this video the latest version is python 3.7.2. Chances are in the future, when you are watching this tutorial, there is a newer  version of Python available, don't worry, all the materials you're going to learn in this course  will apply to the latest version of Python as well.  to see this check box here, add Python to python, this is really important, make sure to tick this box, otherwise you're not going to be able to follow this tutorial. Alright, next we need to install a code editor, we se a code editor to write our code, just like how we use Microsoft Word to write documents, we use a code editor to write code. If you're on a Mac,  you're going to see an installer like this, with this setup wizard we're going to install Python 3 on our computer. That is one of the most popular code editors  for writing Python code. Now there are so many code editors out there, the one that I'm going to show you in this tutorial is PyCharm. If you're on Mac you need to drag and drop this icon  onto the applications folder, so drag and drop,  alright, now let's double click this to run it,  the first time we run pycharm we're going to get this warnin Now, once again look at your downloads folder, once again you should have pycharm  so double click this, now if you're in Windows you're going to see an installation wizard, simply click next, next, next until you install pycharm. Now here on the download page, you can see two versions of PyCharm, one is the professional addition  which has additional features and you have to pay for them. So, go ahead and download this as well. So let's go ahead and download PyCharm. Python interpreter is basically a program  that knows how to execute Python code, it will know how to interpret  or translate Python instructions into instructions a computer can understand. And then next again, one more time, and then finally start using pycharm. Okay, On this page, select I've never used PyCharm you can see some keyword shortcuts that might be useful in the future, just accept this, and down at the bottom,  click the next button. Now before click and create, expand  this item here, make sure that base interpreter is set to Python 3. So here's the main page of PyCharm every time you open it, click on create new project,  this is the location for our project, let's call our project Hello World. So by convention, all Python files should have this py extension. h an older installation of Python, that's Python 2, it's considered legacy which means it's no longer maintained or supported. Alright, let's go ahead, now let's collapse this project panel by clicking here and write our first python program. So earlier we downloaded  Python 3, make sure that this is set to Python 3, if not from this list, select Python 3.7. Alright, now let's go ahead and create this project, Now here right click on Hello World folder and go to new  Python file, call this file app.py. Now if you didn't see the result I showed you in this video, use the comment box below and So as you can see my name is printed here, now as you print code, this window might get in the way so always resize it or minimize itty putting this icon here, so this was our first python program.  there is a shortcut associated with this command, when I program I always use shortcuts because that increases my productivity. So let's do that, now it's asking where you want to run this, click on app,  down below, you should see this little terminal window, this is a little window into our program, so here you can see our results for output for our program. That is a little bit complicated, so for now we're going to use this little terminal window to see the results of our program. In this Python tutorial, we're gong to take this program to the next level and make it more interesting. alright, now one more time another print statement with quotations, now we need to draw the legs. So I'm going to show you how to draw a dog hair. So, add an o, that is the head of our dog, followed by 4 hyphens. So press enter, and  on line 2 write another print statement, so print, open and close parenthesis, add a quotation, now here you want to draw a dog. Let's add  another print statement, with quotations now in between the quotations, add a star or an asterisk, like this. So first it executes line 1,  then, moves onto line 2, and so on. So earlier I told you about Python interpreter  that is the program that knows how to translate or interpret  our Python code into instructions that a computer can understand. So when we run this program by clicking this program here,  python interpreter starts executing or running our program  line by line from the top. g. Now what you need to understand  here, is that our python code gets executed line by line from the top. An expression is a piece of  code that produces a value. Now what we have here, this piece of code here,  is called an expression. So we have 10 asterisks. So when Python interpreter  tries to execute line 4, first it will evaluate  the code that we put in between parenthesis, so we could evaluate our expressions  Our expression will produce 10 asterisks and then those asterisks will be printed on the terminal. So with this piece of code we can draw 10 asterisks on the terminal, let me show you. So whatever you want to do you need to take additional courses. Learning all these things would take you another  6 months, so in total you need 9-12 months to become job ready. it take to learn Python and become job ready? For example if you want to become a web developer in addition to learning Python, you should also learn about html, some css, some JavaScript and Django which is a popular Python framework  for building web applications. In order to get a job, you need to specialize in one area, what do you want to use python for? Now as you work more as you do more Python projects, your resume starts to build and  you can ask for $100,000 a year, or 120,000 dollars a year, depending on where you are, what company, what geographical area,  it really depends, there is no single answer. So are you excited to learn Python and get started on this career path? can get a junior developer job with a  salary of about 50-60 thousand dollars a year. In this Python tutorial, you're going to learn about variables, which are one of the most fundamental  concepts in programming, they're not specific to Python, they exist  in pretty much every programming language out there. And use the comment box below and let me know why you are learning  Python, what do you want to do with it? So, put it in quotations, and type price,  now, let's run this program one more time, there you go. 's type price = 10, when Python interpreter executes this code, it will allocate some memory, then it will store  the number 10 in that memory, and finally it will attach this price label in that memory location. So we see 10,  on the terminal. So now, let's  print price on the terminal. In that box, we have number 10 and price is the label that we put on the box. So this number 10,  is in the decimal system which has all the digits from 0 to 9. So first we set  the price to 10, then we reset it to 20, and finally we  print it on the terminal, let's run the terminal, there you go, so,  we see 20 here, okay? Then it will get stored in the computer's memory. about to be stored in the memory, first it will get converted to this binary for presentation. So when we store the number 10 in the computer's memory first it will get converted to it's binary representation which will be  a bunch of 0's and 1's, like 001, 001, whatever  I don't know. Now in programming, we refer to this kind of number as  a floating point number of float for short. But integer is a number without a decimal point. We can also define a variable and set it to a string, for example, name equals  Mosh, we also have another kind of value which is called boolean,  which can be true or false. re whole numbers without a decimal point. We can also use numbers with a decimal point for example on line 2, we can define another variable called rating and set it to number 4.9. Imagine we're going to write a program for a hospital. And that's what I'm going to show you in the future. Make sure to spell this with a capital F, or if you want to set this to true,  make sure the T is capital, so in this program, you're storing simple values in our computer's memory. I want you to define 3 variables here,  for his name, his age, and another variable  for if this is a new or an existing patient. So before going any further, I want you  to do a little exercise. Alright, so here we need three variables, the first one is the patient's name,  we set that to John Smith. The second variable is for the age of our patient. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to  receive input from the user. So age  is 20, and finally we need a variable to tell if this is a new  or existing patient. So instead of print we're going to use input. So we're going to use the input function, now whenever we have these parenthesis, we're going to say we're calling or executing  that function, it's like pressing a button on a remote control. Whatever the user enters this input function will return. Now on the second line we want to print So this input function will print this message on the terminal, and then it will wait for the user to enter a value. So we're going to call the input function and in between parenthesis we want to add a string to print something on the terminal,  what is your name? So here's another example of an expression. Remember what is an expression? Let's run this program and see what happens. a message like Hi John or Hi Mosh or whatever, so,  print, quotations Hi with a space, now after the quotation we want to dynamically print what we have in the name variable. So let's type whatever here, plus enter, now we get this message, Hi, Mosh. all the person's name and then their favorite color. So, favorite color,  now let's run this program, so what is your name Mosh enter, favorite color, blue, enter,  we get this message, Mosh likes blue. color. What is your favorite color? With the favorite color. So I have done my best to create the best possible Python course on Youtube. Now let's get the return value and store it in a variable,  called birth_year. So, let's start with our input function, input  let's print birth here, followed by a colon,  and a space. In this Python tutorial, we're going to write a program that will ask the year that we were born in, and then it will calculate our age and print it on the terminal. Alright, now, let's move onto the next tutorial. So, my birth year is 1982, enter,  oops, we got an error, what is going on here? So,  next to the file you can see the file that generated this error, in this case that is app.py. So that is where we're calculating the age, and right below that you can see the type of error. In this case, we have a type error, and here's the message. So in this file,  on line 2, this is where we got this error, and right below that we can see the piece of code that generated this error. 1982. One is an integer and the other is a string. This string is different from the actual number 1982. 2019 -  string 1982. So int is short for integer and that represents a whole number  and str is short for string, so here we're subtracting  a string from an integer, and Python doesn't know what to do with it. We have a few other functions for converting values into different types. And we also have bool for converting a string  into a  boolean value. So to fix this problem,  we need to go back on line 2,  and pass this birth year variable to the int function like this. So we have  int for converting a string into an integer, we also have float for converting a string into a float, or a number with a decimal point. int parenthesis, like this so we pass this string to the int function, int will convert it into an itneger and then Python interpreter will be able to evaluate this expression. So pause the video, do the exercise and when you're ready come back to watch it. I want you to write a program  ask the user their weight and then convert it to kilograms and print it on a terminal. Okay? So let's run our program, so birth year one more time, 1982, okay, here's the result so the type of birth year as you can see is a class of str or strings, we look at classes in the future so for now don't worry about them, and also below them you cans ee the type of the age variable is int or integer. ear, so right after line 1,  let's print, now here we're going to call another built in function,  called type, and now let's pass birth  year, okay, now similarly after line  3, let's also print the type of age, so print type of age. So my weight is 160, alright once again we got an error,  can't multiply sequence by non int of type float. So let's call the int function. And finally let's print weight underline kg. Let's run this Python program and see what happens. o let's use our input function and ask for the weight in pounds here we get the weight in lbs or pounds now we need to convert this into kilograms, it's very easy so we defined another variable weight_kg  we set this to weight_lbs times 0.45. So we want to add an apostrophe, like this,  Course for Beginners. th single and double quotes to define a string, but there are times you have to use a specific form, otherwise you're going to run into issues. Imagine you wanted to change this string into Pythons course for Beginners. So let's change this to double quotes, now you can see it adds another double quote to close it,  you have to manually remove this, and also one more time at the beginning of the string, we need to add another double quote. So to solve this problem we need to use double quotes to define our string so we can have  a single quote in the middle of the string. So these are the cases for using single or double quotes. we don't want this apostrophe here, so we have Python for Beginners, but we want to put Beginners in double quotes. Once again, if you add a double quote here Python interpreter gets confused because it assumes the second double quote indicates that end of the string, so it doesn't know what these characters are, so to solve this we need to change our double quotes to single quotes  like this. Now we add three quotes, so 1, 2, 3, there you go,  So, we have three quotes to start our string and And then we can add double quotes in the middle of the string. Now, let's run this program and here's the result. So to get the first character we use square brackets  and type 0. So the index of the first character is 0, the second character is 1, and so on. So the index of the first character  in the string is 0. Now here we're going to use square  brackets to get a character and a given index in this string. Let's run it one more time,  now we get R because that is the second character from the end. n also use a negative  index here. So we have negative index we can get the characters started from the end. So when we run  this program we should see s. Let's run it, there you go, we get s, if we pass negative 2, this will return the second character from the end. So if I pass negative 1 here,  Assuming that 0 is the index of the first character  negative 1 is the index of the last character. But if you change the start index to 1,  this will exclude the first character so when we run this program, we see ython so p is removed.  0,  colon 3, Python interpreter will return all the characters starting with this index all the way to this second index, but it does not return the character at this index. So run this program, there you go, Python for Beginners. When you run this program. Python interpreter will return the characters starting from the index 0 all the way to index 3,  but excludes the character and index 3,  so when we run this Python program we're going to see pint (?). Let's take a look, so,  let's print another, and load our program there you go, we get Python for beginners. Now what if we leave both the start and end index? Python interpreter will assume  0 as the start index, so, let's run this program, there you go, we get pytho.  value for the start index, so if we don't supply the start index  but add an end index like 5. Now in this case 0 will be assumed as the start index, and the length of the string will assume as the end index. In this tutorial, we're going to look at  formatted strings in Python programming language. I want you to use your knowledge  to tell what we're going to see on the terminal, we're now running this program. So I'm going to run this program  there you go. Now when we print name  of 1: negative 1 what do you think we're going to see on the terminal? In this case, the first character from the in is r, so r will be excluded, in other words we're going to see all the characters starting from e all the way  to the second e. Let's take a look. ings are particularly useful in situations where you dynamically generate some text with your variables. Let me show you. Let's say we want to print this on the terminal. Let's say we have two variables  first name and last name. So let's say with these two variables, we want to generate some text like this. So,  I'm going to define another variable, let's say msg short for message, and set this to a formatted string. Next we add a space, we add our square brackets, in between the square  brackets, we want to display the last name so once again we add curly braces, and type last, and finally here we type  is a coder. Now in between the quotes, first we want to add the value of the first name variable, so,  we add curly braces and here we type first. A formatted string is one that is prefixed with an f. So f,  quotes. So this is what we call the formatted string. So here we have two place holders or two holes in our string. So let's start by defining a variable,  course and we set that to Python for beginners. Now to calculate the number of characters in this string, you can use a built in function called len. string, and when we run our program these holes  will be filled with the value of our variables. But compare this formatted string with string  concatenation. Let's run this program,  so as you can see we have 20 characters in this string, this is  particularly useful when you receive input from the user. For example you have noticed that when you fill out a form online, each input field  often has a limit. So it's a general purpose function. If the user types in more characters than we allow,  we can display an error, now, this,  len function is another function built into Python, it's  a general purpose function, so it's not limited to counting the number of characters in a  string, in the future when we look at lists, I want to show you that we can use this function to count the number of items in a list. For example, you might have 50 characters for your name,  so using this len function we can enforce a limit on the number of characters  in an input field. Now in more accurate terms,  you refer to these function as methods, this is a term  in object oriented programming that we want to look at in the future, but for now, what I want you to take away, is that when a function belongs to something else, or is specific  to some kind of object, we refer to that function as a method. let me show you. So first we type course,  then dot look these are all the functions  that are specific to strings. For example, here we have this function, upper, for converting the string  into upper case, now more accurately because this function is specific to a string, we refer to this as a method. Now let's take  look at this upper method. So let me show you. Call course. Now, let's run the program, so on the second line you can see,  all characters are in lower case. Print, course.lower. So,  if we print our course variable right after we call the upper method, we can see that our course variable still  has it's original form, so let's run this program one more time, there you  go. So let's print the result we get 0, because the  index of the first capital p in the string is 0. Now note that the find method is case sensitive, so it's sensitive to  lower case and and upper case characters. We can also pass a sequence of characters, for example, we can pass beginners with a capital B let's run this program, we get 11 because  beginners starts with index 11, now we also have method for replacing a character or a sequence of characters and that is called replace. As an example if you pass an upper case  here and run this program, we get negative 1 because we don't have an upper case o anywhere in this string, okay? As another example, if we pass a lower case o here,  let's see what we get, we get 4 because  the index of this o here is 4.  pass absolute beginners. Again, this method like the find method is case sensitive so  if you pass beginners all in lowercase, this method is not going to find this exact word in our string, so it's not going to place it with absolute beginners. Now when we run this program we get jython for beginners. So I'm going to run the program One more time, look, we still get python for beginners. Okay, now let's run this program, so, we get python for absolute beginners. o we're checking to see if python is in course variable. We can use the len function to count the number of characters in a string, this is the general purpose function built into python, we also have And this is an expression that produces a boolean value, and I get true or false, so we refer to this expression as a boolean expression, now if we print this on the terminal,  we should get true, and by the way  I'm going to delete the second line, we don't need it anymore, so run the program  we get true, but if I change this capitol p to a lower case p and run the program we get false because we don't have is exact sequence of characters in our strings. So that's the difference. Now note that the difference between the in operator and the find method is that our find method returns the index of  character or sequence of characters but the in operator  produces a boolean value. Now in this tutorial you're going to look at the arithmetic operations supported in python language these are the same arithmetic operations that we have in math, we can add numbers,  multiply them and so on. So some characters  in a string.  specific functions  for strings which we refer to as methods, these include  upper for converting a string into uppercase you also have lower and title methods,  you learn about the find method which returns the index  of a character or sequence of characters, we have  the replace method for replacing characters and words in a string and finally  you learned about the in operator. Which are numbers with a decimal point. So, you have learned that in Python programming language you have 2  types of numbers, integers which are whole numbers like 10, they don't have a decimal point, and floating point numbers or floats. So let's run this program  we get 1000 so these are the arithmetic operators  in python programming language. But we also have another division operator for getting an integer. So when we run this program  we should get 1, there you go. So  if we add another slash here and run this program  we get an integer. tiplication, we have two kinds of division,  here's one with a forward slash, let's run this program and see what we get. Now augmented assignment operator is a way to write the same code but in a shorter form. So this is what we call the augmented assignment operator we have augmented or enhanced the assignment operator. this to x plus 3. We type x plus  equals 3. Now in this particular  case we are incremented a number using the augmented assignment operator, but we can also subtract or multiply a number by a given value for example, let's delete what we have on line 2,  we can type subtract equals 3. This is the order of operations. The answer is 16. So this is what we call operator precedence, it's just a basic math concept. So the multiplication operator has  a higher precendence which means it's applied first which means 3 x  2 is executed first, the result is 6 and then  its added to 10, that's why x showed up as 16 after we run this code, let's verify that. Because in math we have this concept called operator precedence which means the order of operations. So let's run this program and verify this. In this case we can add parenthesis  around 10 + 3, so this piece of 3 will be  executed first, the result is 13, then the exponentiation  operator will be executed, so 2 to the power of 2 is 4,  and finally 4 is multiplied by 13. The answer is 22. So x should be 22. X  is 22. Now to round this number we can use the built in round function, so we call the round function, give it x,  and then print the result. Let's run thi Let's verify this, print  x, run the program there you go, I hope you guessed it right. The result of these 5. So next, 5 will be multiplied by 10, the result is  50 and finally we have subtraction. But technically in Python we have a handful of built in functions for performing  mathematical operations, if you want to write a program that involves complex  mathematical calculations, you need to import the math module. So absolute always returns a positive number. When you go to a super market  you see different sections for fruits and vegetables, cleaning products,  junk food Let's call the abs function  and give it negative 2.9 When we run this program  we're gong to see 2.9 on the terminal. s program  so, we get 3, we have another useful built in function called  abs which is short for absolute, and this is the absolute function  we have in math, we give it a value and it always returns  the positive representation of this value, even if the value is negative. Now there are so many functions built in this module and we don't re look these are all the mathematical  functions available in this module. On the top  we type import, math, all in  lowercase  with this we can import the math module. So, let me show you how to use this module. So in Python we have this math module which contains a bunch of rustable functions for performing mathematical calculations. In this tutorial, I'm going to talk to you about if statements in Python  if statements are extremely important in programming and they allow us to build programs that can make decisions based on some condition. Make sure to add the version python 3. Open up your browser and search for Python 3 math module. Because the math module in python 2 is slightly different from the math module in  python 3. So python 3 math module,  now here you can see the documentation of this kind of module  let's go let's have a look, if you scroll down,  we can see the list of all the functions and their explanation. So,  back to our program here, we start by defining a boolean variable  is underline hot. Otherwise, if it's cold, so here's another condition if this condition is true we're going to tell the user it's a cold day  so where warm clothes. In this case, we want to tell the user hey it's a hot day, drink plenty of water. And otherwise if it's either hot or cold, we want to tell the user it's a lovely day. If it's a hot day, perhaps we want to tell the user it's a hot day, so make sure to drink plenty of water. But if I go over here and  change this boolean value to false and run the program again, our first message disappears and we only see the second messag So,  it's a hot day. Now any code that we write here will be executed  if this condition is true, otherwise it will be ignored. Now when we run this program, because this condition is true, you're doing to say this message followed by this second message, take a look, so run, there you go, it's a hot day enjoy your day. Now let's press enter you can see the cursor is still indented, that means we can write more code  that we executed if this condition is true, in this case let's say we don't want to write any extra code, so to terminate this block  we need to press shift and tab, now the cursor is at the beginning of the line so lets write a print statement with a message like enjoy your day. So I'm going to revert is hot to true  and run the program one more time. You don't see any message about a cold day. e, enjoy  your day. So we get the message  about a hot day followed by enjoy your day. There you go, so  it's a hot day, drink plenty of water, and enjoy your day. It's a cold day wear warm clothes and enjoy your day. So let' say  is underline cold we set this to true. So,  el if which is short for els if or otherwise if, now here we add another condition, so,  is cold So if t's cold you want to execute these few lines. If it's not hot it doesn't necessarily mean that it's cold, it means it's a lovely day. Back to our conditions, here on line 4 we have this rule that says  if it's a cold day, then print these messages otherwise if it's neither hot or cold say it's a lovely day. it's a cold day,  where warm clothes and and enjoy your day. So, right now,  is hot is false, is cold is true,  so when we run this program, python interpreter is going to execute the first  if statement, in this case because our condition is false, these two lines will be ignored, then Python interpreter will look at  line 7, it will evaluate this condition, in this case is cold is true so we're going to see these two messages on the terminal. It's a lovely  day. Now,  back to the top, if we change is cold  to false it's neither hot nor cold so it's going to be a lovely day. Let's run the program, and here you go, it's a lovely day Imagine the price of a house is 1 million dollars. Alright let's define a variable for the price of this house so price  we set this to 1 million so 1 with 6 0s. That is 10 percent of the price of this property. Next we need a variable to tell if this buyer has good credit  so has good credit,  and we set this to true, now we need an if statement  so if has good credit has true  colon, here we need to calculate a down payment so the down_payment should be equal to 0.1 x the price. Now if the buyer has good credit, they will need to put down 10 percent  of the price of this property otherwise they need to put down 20 percent  write a program with these rules an display the down payment  card for a buyer with good credit. Now finally we remove the indentation and print here we can use a form  of valid string, first we add a label, down payment  colon and right after that we add a placeholder  or a hole for our down payment variable. So curly braces  down payment. Let's run this program, so down payment for a buyer with good credit  is 100,000 dollars. So in this example we have two conditions, one is having  high income and the other is havi So back to our formatted string, just before the curly brace I'm going to add a dollar sign let's run this one more time, that is better. So I'm going to run this program  so we see it eligible for loan, but if we change  either of these conditions to false, and run the program a So, back to our program, let's define two variables,  has high income, we set this to true. So if both these conditions are true, then the applicant is eligible for a loan. So if both these conditions are true  then this message will be printed. And another one has good  credit, we also set this to true, now our if statement  if has high income has true,  and has good credit is also true,  then we're going to print eligible  for null. If you change this to false  but set the other condition to true, we still see the same result, but if both these conditions are false  then we're not going to see this message anymore. So this is the logical and operator. Now back to our program we can  implement this rule by using the logical or operator. So we simply replace  and with or, now when we run this program we're going to see this message because at least one of our conditions is true,  let's take a look. We also have the logical or, and we want to use that in situations where we want to do certain things at least one of the conditions is true, for example let's change  the rule for this program, such that if the applicant has high income,  or good credit, then they're eligible for a loan,  so if either or both these conditions are true then the candidate is eligible. Now, we want to check to see if this applicant has good credit and not a criminal record. For example  let's make up a new room, if applicant  has good credit and doesn't have  a criminal record then they're eligible for a loan. Let's set this variable to true we also define another variable like has criminal  record. So, if they have good credit,  and not criminal  record. So, in this example, has criminal record is set to false, when we use the not operator this b And when we run this program we see this familiar message. asically gets changed to true, so we have two conditions that are true. So true changes to false. And we'll end up with two conditions, one that's true and the other is false. However if an applicant has a criminal record, so let's change this to  true, now when we run this program we can see our applicant is not eligible because when we apply then operator on this variable, we'll get false. So run,  it's not a hot day. Now,  when we run this program, we're going to see this second message because 30 is not greater than 30. Back to app.py, I define this temperature value, let's write an if statement, if temperature now we want to check to see if this is greater than 30, so we use  the greater than operator. Now if you change the temperature to 35 and run this again,  we're going to see a different message, it's a hot day, so this is where we use comparison operators. If this is greater than 30,  we want to print it's a hot day otherwise, let's just print  it's not a hot day. Note that this is different from the assignment operator  that has only one equals sign. You can see that if we use only one equal sign here we immediately get this red underline because this is simply  an assignment statement. We're changing the value of the temperature. So, our equality operator  has two equal signs and finally we have not equal which is an exclamation followed by an equal sign.  equal to, we have less then, less then or equal to,  here's the equality operator, so if the temperature equals to 30,  then you can say it's a hot day. Otherwise if the name is between 3 and 50 characters then we just want to tell the user that name looks good. So we use the len function, right? or, like name must be at least three characters,  otherwise, if the name is more then 50 characters long then we want  to display a different validation error like name can be a maximum of 50 characters. So el if len of name is greater than 50,  then we want to print a different message, name,  must be a maximum  of 50 chara Now here we want to use an if statement so if len of name is less then  3, then we want to print  name must be at least 3 characters now here we need a second condition  to check the upper limit. So I enter my weight in pounds so 100 and 60 now it's telling me if it's in pounds or kilograms. Let's  run our program. Now we want to extend this program  and allow the user to enter their weight in either kilograms or pounds and then we will convert it to the other unit. Here's another good exercise that combines  many of the materials you have learned so far, so earlier you built a program to  convert someone's weight from pounds to kilograms. And then we run our program we're going to see a different message name must be a  maximum of 50 characters and finally if we type a proper name here like John Smith and run our program we get name  looks good. So we use the input function, weight colon we get the return value and store it in the variable called weight. So if unit  equals l then we need to convert this weight  into kilograms. for kilograms. Or k for kilograms. Let's run this program one more time,  this time I'm going to enter my weight in kilo's, so send it to is the weight and the unit is kilograms so k,  and it says you are 160 pounds. So, we can use the dot operator to access all it's methods or functions, here we call the upper method, this will convert whatever the user enters to upper case and then we'll convert it  to a capital l. Now, if this condition is true,  then we need to get the weight and multiply it by 0,  .45 However, as you know this weight is a string object, and we cannot multiply a string  by a floating point number, we talked about this earlier in this course. So this is where we use the upper method of string objects so this unit is a string because as I told you before, the input function always returns a string. Now, the in function will return an integer so we can store it in this weight  variable. So  right here, when we call the input function, we can get the return value and pass it to the int function. So,  we call the int function and give it the return value of the input function. Now let's run this program and see what happens. In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to use y loops in python. We need to divide the weight by 0.45. q So, weight divided by 0.45 and just to refresh your memory, this division operator returns a floating point number but if we use double slashes we'll get an integer. ht, let's store it in a variable called converted,  then we print here we can use a formatted string, so we prefix this string with f ur we add curly braces to dynamically insert the value of converted variable. In this case, we want to get a floating point number,  finally let's print a formatted string, ur  curly braces, converted  pounds. So we set i to i plus 1. So, let's get started with the basics, we write a y statement  and right after that, we type a condition followed by a colon as long as this condition is true the quote that we write  in this block will be repeatedly executed. Now we set our condition to i less than or equal to 5, so as long as I is less then or equal to 5, we can print i,  on the terminal. Because this condition will always be true. One is always less then 5, so in every iteration of this loop, we increment i by 1, so at some point, i is gonna be six and then that is when this condition will be false and then we'll jump out of this loop, okay? So it doesn't go to the next statement. So,  we come back here and now we are in the second iteration. ything works after this loop I'm going to add a print statement say done. So heres how this program gets executed first we set i to 1 now python interpreter executes line 2, this condition is true because i is less then 5,  so i is printed on the terminal and then incremented by 1. In the second iteration i is 2, and because 2 is less then 5, our condition is still true, so i will be printed on the terminal, and once again it will be incremented by 1, so at some point i is going to be 6,  and that's when this condition will be false so our look will be terminated and this done message will be printed on the terminal. In the second iteration i is 2, so when we multiply 2 by 1 asterisks, we'll get 2 asterisks. Now let's make this program a little bit more interesting. We add a string, and in this string we add an asterisk and then we multiply this string by i. For example, if i is two, this expression will produce a  string with two asterisks. So with this expression, we can repeat a string, when we multiply a string by a number, that string will be repeated. So while condition colon What is our condition here? So let's go ahead and build this program using a y loop. let's run the program one more time, this time I'm going to guess the number, it's 9, there you go, it says you in. Now we need a while loop to repeatedly ask a user to make a guess. If I can't guess the number the program  tells me that  I failed. So right click on i variable,  and then go to refactor and  rename it. So, let's define a variable called guess limit say to 3, and then we can change 3 to guess underline limit, now our code is mor Let's change this to guess_count enter, there you go, now that is better,  also it's better to store 3 in a separate variable to make our code more readable, because it's not quite clear what does 3 represent here. Let me show you how to rename. So it's better to rename this variable to guess, count. So if this condition is true we want to  tell the user they won. So okay it's asking me to make a guess, I'm g e readable while guess count is less then guess limit, see it reads like a story this is how you should write code. Okay, so while this condition is true, we want toast the user to make a guess. So at this point the user made a guess, now we need to increment guess count so guess count we set it to plus equal 1 or  okay, now we need to check to see if the user will make the right guess. So we need to change our program such that if the user makes the right guess, we need to terminate our while loop, we need to jump out of it. So, over here if the user makes the right guess, after we print this message we can use the brick statement to terminate terminate a loop, when python interpreter sees this, it's going to immediately terminate our loop, it's not going to evaluate this condition again. So, 9 okay it says you won, but it's still asking me to make a guess, because our while loop is going to get executed 3 times. So, I'm going to guess the right number, you won and look, you are now asked to make two more guesses, b We're going to take care of it momentarily, but let's run the program one more time and make the right guess. Now the last thing we need to add here is the message that tells the user that they failed if they could not guess the right number. But if the user cannot guess this number, you're never going to break out of this similar to the if statements. If the user guesses the right number, you break this loop, you jump out of it so the code that we write in the else block will not get executed. Now, similar to the if statements Our while loops, our while statements can also have an else part. So, print, sorry you failed. So let's see how this works. This time I'm going to make a wrong guess, and then the right guess,  we won and our loop terminated immediately. Now, let's test the program one more time. So, guess 1, 2, 3,  sorry you failed, let's run it one more time. We want to run this loop  until the user types quit. So we can define a variable or a story to command what the user enters, and then we can run this loop as long as the command does not equal to quit. Any other commands that we type our program is going to tell us hey I don't understand that. For example, if I type asd here, it's going to say I don't understand  that.If you type start, we get this message,  car started, ready to go, if you type stop it  says car stopped, and finally if we hit quit our program terminates, this is a fantastic exercise for you to practice wha you have learned, so pause the video and spend 5-10 minutes to build this program. So we can type the start command to start our car, we can type stop command to stop our car, and quit to terminate the game. With this quit. It's about our personal preference  in this demo I'm going to use lower case characters. So then we type out our condition as while command  does not equal to quit then do something. You could also call this upper and then type quit in upper case. Now immediately we have a problem here because we're assuming that the user  types the command in lower case, so if they type this in upper case they our program is not going to behave properly, so to fix this problem, you need to call the lower method of the string object and then compare the results. So print the car started. What if its not start, maybe it's stop? Start,  stop, and help. So,  el if command.lower equals stop, there you go, then we print a  different message car stopped. So, if command.lower equals start then you want to print the message  like the car started. We need one more el if. If the command equals help, then,  we want to show the commands that we support. Now, the third command. Now finally we need  an else part, so if what the user enters is none of these commands,  we're going to tell them, hey we don't understand these,  else, colon print  sorry I don't understand that. ring, we can immediately call the lower method on this string, and with this command  will always be in lowercase, so we don't need to call this method in every condition.  run our program up to this point and see what happens. In other words when we run this program and type quit, our program actually quits but  we still see this message which shouldn't appear here. Anything else will end up here, so that's why our program says it doesn't understand that. At this point our command is quit, so our loop will complete and the program terminates. So that's why our program  says it doesn't understand that command. So,  quit now our program terminates and we don't see that message  beautiful. Now let's test our program one more time. el if command equals  quit then you can immediately break.  add another el if, something like this. The reality is that we don't really need this condition on the top, because with these if statements  well more accurately with this el if we can jump out of this loop and terminate  our program. And similarly  if the car is already started and the user tries to start it again,  the program should yell at the user. And if we type start again  we get the same message. It would be better if we got a message like car is already started so it doesn't make sense to start a car twice. Similarly, if we type stop it says car stopped, if we type it again we get the exact same message, it doesn't make sense to stop the car twice. So right now if we type start we get this message car started. Alright to add this to our program, we need  to know if the car is started or not. So the car is not started, right? Now when the user types the start command, here we need to check to see if the car is already started. If not started, So in this block we'll write another if statement, if it's already started and we print car is already  started. so here we're using the not operator to see if the car is stopped. So, initially our car is stopped. Now let's stop it it says the car is stopped, let's stop it one more time, we get this message  again. So if it stopped we print car is already stopped with double p's, otherwise so else  we need to stop the car, how do we do that? So I'm going to type  stop, it says the car is already stopped, so lets  start it, okay, now our car is started, let's start it one more time. We type out for then we define a variable, this is what we call a loop variable. So, let's call it item, in  here we type out a string like Python, and then  colon. Because a string is a sequence of characters, so it looks like a collection  so we can use a for loop to iterate over each character in a  string and then do something with it. In each iteration, this variable will hold one item. So with this for loop we can iterate over a string and in each iteration this item variable will hold one character at a time in the first iteration it will be set to p then  in the second iteration it will be set to y, and in the third iteration it will be set to t and so on. So here we can define a list of names like Mosh,  Jon, Sarah, and then go ahead  and run our program so we can see in each iteration we get one name  and print it on a new line. So, we give it a number, let's In Python we can define lists using square brackets, so let me remove this string from here, and define a list using square brackets,  a list is simply a list of items, a list of numbers, a list of  customers, a list of emails, products, blog posts, whatever. So, let me delete this,  In Python we have a built in function called range, for creating range of numbers. We can also loop over a list of numbers, for example,  1, 2, 3, 4, let's run it, again we see each number on a new line, but what if we want a list of numbers? Also, this range function can optionally take a step, so we can pass two asa step to this function,  and when we run our program, we can see our first number is 5, now we go two steps forward to get 7,  once again we go to two steps forward we get 9 and that is the end of our range. So let's say we have a list of So, let's run our program, now we have the numbers  5, 6, 7, and 9. We can also work with a  range of numbers here, let's say you want to start  from 5, and go all the way to 10. say 10,  let's run this program, now we can see here on the terminal we have 0 all the way to 9.  prices like 10,  20, and 30, I want you to use a for loop,  to calculate the total cost of all the items in our imaginary shopping cart,  so calculate that, and then print it on the terminal. In the first iteration it's going to hold 10, then it's gooing to be 20, and then it's going to be 30. Now in each iteration this price will hold one value. So for price,  in prices. So in this example we're going to use a for loop to iterate over the list of prices. Now in each iteration we get the current price and add it to the total so we write total equals total plus price  or as you learned earlier we can use the augmented  assignment operator to simplify this code. This total variable has  a total of all the prices we can simply print it here,  or we can use a formatted string, so a string  prefix with f, the other label, like total,  curly braces to dynamically include some value in our string,  in this case our total variable. Using a nested loop basically means adding one loop inside of another loop, and with this technique we can do some amazing things for example we can easily generate a list of coordina So, after our for loop. late the total so we define that outside of our for loop, let's call it total and initially we set it to 0. Let me show you. So inside of this loop we're going to add another loop, so instead of just printing x first we want to add  another loop, for y in range  let's say 3, now we can print x and y together  so, print, here, we use a formatted str So, we start with one loop, let's say for x in range 4. Now let's say you wan to generate a list of coordinates like this. Let's say 0 and 0. Now we are on line 2, here we have a new loop which we call an inner loop. So in the first iteration,  of our outer loop, x is 0. In this inner loop, in the first iteration y  is going to be 0, so we print 0 and 0 on the terminal. Now the control goes back to line 2 or our inner loop. Once again, the control goes back to line 2, we are in the third  iteration of our inner loop , so this will continue until our inner loop completes. So x will be  1, then the control will be moved to line 2, or our inner  loop, at this point, this range function is going to generate the numbers 0 to 3 one more time. So this inner loop will be executed 3 times. And then we'll go back to our outer loop. After this inner loop completes,  then the control goes back to line 1, and at this point we're going to be in the second iteration of our outer loop. So,  for example, the first item in this list, this tells us that we should have  5 x's on the first line. In each iteration you get one number, this determines the number of x's to be displayed on that particular line.  have this list, called numbers, in this list we have these values,  5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2. So if you want to cheat,  you can get this number and multiply by a string that contains x,  so if you multiply x by 5, we'll get 5 x's, that's not what  I want you to do. These values determine the number of x's we have in each line. It just requires a little bit of focus. It is a little bit challenging, but it's not extremely difficult.  problem we need a nested loop. So this is the beauty of Python, with Python we can write expressions like this, we can multiply a string by a number to repeat it. But for this exercise, I wanted you to imagine that we don't have this feature in Python  so you will have to use an inner loop to solve this problem. So now in each iteration we simply need to append an x to our output variable. So,  we can use another loop for count in range,  of x underline count. , x count is going to be 5. At this point x count is going to be 2, now on line 3, we're going to reset our output variable to an empty string. So in our first iteration x count is going to be 5, so range of 5 would generate the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. So, I'm going to define a list of names, let's send them to John Bob Mosh  Sarah and Mary. So we can also access an individual element using an index just like how we can access an individual character in a string using an index. The index of the f So, here we type out square brackets,  and specify an index. So,  if you print this list here, what we see on the terminal look exactly like how we define our lists we have square brackets, and in between these square brackets we have our item our items, so we have 5 strings in this list. So let's run this program there you go. This will get all items starting from the index of 2, that is Mosh here all the way to the end of the string. We can also specify  an end index, let's say 4, so this will return all the items up to this index, but it doesn't include the item at this index. We get this list with 3  items, Mosh, Sarah, and Mary. So, let's run this program, there you go,  we get Jon now if you want to print out the third element in this list it's index is 2, so names of 2,  returns Mosh, now we can also pass a negative index here, so negative 1, refers to the last item  in this list, that is Mary, let's run the program,  there you go, we see Mary, if you pass negative 2, this returns the second item from the end of the list. So if you go back here and print our original  list of names right after you can see it's not affected. And also here we have default values, so if you leave out the end index this expression is going to return  all the items starting from the index of 2, to the end of the list or if you leave out the start index, this expression asumes 0 as the default index, so it will return all the items from the beginning to the end of the list. So here we want to use square brackets with a colon to select a  range of items, we get a new list, and by the way we can also  modify any of the elements in this list. For example, if we pass 2 here, you can see this returns a new list with 3 items. And by the way,  just like strings, these square brackets here, don't modify our original list, they simply return a new list. Now, let's print our list  so, you can see the first item in this list  is now data. We're only assuming that the first item  is the largest number. I want you to write a program to find the largest number  in your list. We need to define another  variable let's call it max, this variable will hold the largest number, now initially you want to assume  the first item in this list is the largest number. Now to find the largest number in this list. Is 3 greater than 3. It is, so we should reset max to 8. It is, so we need to reset max  to 6. So here we need a for loop, for number in numbers colon  now we need too heck to see if this number is greater than max,  so, if number is greater than max,  max colon then we need to reset max, so max to this new number, that's all we had to do. If it's greater than Max, then we need to reset max to that number. Let's run our program, we still see 10, if I put this somewhere in the middle, our program should still work. Now we can model this in python using  a 2 dimensional list. We set it to a list, each item in this list, is going to be another list, and that list represents Here's an example, In math we have a concept called matrix, which is like a rectangular array of numbers, let me show you. A 2 dimensional list is a list where each item in that list is another list. So, this is how we can implement a matrix in python, now to access an individual item in our matrix,  once again we use square brackets, let me delete this stuff,  alright, so how do we access 1 here,  well, you start with our list then we add square  brackets first we need to go and get the first item in this list. So, the first item in our list is going to be another list, and in this other list we're going to have the values 1, 2, and 3. In this list,  let's say you want to access the second item, so,  once again we add square brackets, and we pass 1, that  is the index of 2 in this list, alright. So as you can see we have a 2 dimensional list Each item in our outer list is another list. Now the second  item in our matrix list, once again, we have a list,  this list represents the items in the second row. So, let's run this program,  there you go, we get all the item in our list. So we need to loop over this row which is a list of items. Okay? Okay? So,  we start with a rows for the rows in matrix,  so with this loop, we are iterating over our Matrix list, in each iteration row will contain 1  list, 1 item, okay? In fact recently I published a  comprehensive python course that goes way beyond this beginners  youtube. And if you're serious about learning python and getting a job, I highly encourage  you to enroll in this course. So let's define  a list of numbers, here we pass a bunch of random numbers, like 5, 2, 1, 7, and These are the operations that we can perform in a list. In this tutorial, I'm going to talk to you guys about the list methods, or list functions. For that we use a different method, that is called insert. Now there are a number of things we can do with this list, we can add new items to it, we can remove existing items, we can check for the existence of an item  these are the operations that we can perform on a list. I'm joking I'm not superstitious, so let's add 20, it doesn't really matter and then print our list  when we run the program we can see 20 is added at the end of this list  but what if you want to add a number somewhere in the middle, or at the beginning of our list? So, insert, now this method takes 2 values, let me show you. So we can call the append method to add a new item to this list. We can also remove an item so we call remove and pass the item that we want to remove 5. If you want to remove all the items in the list, you can call the clear method, so, clear  this method doesn't take any values, so, we simply call it and it empties our list, all the items are removed. We also have another useful method called hop,  and with this we can remove the last item in a list. Let's say we want to add the number 10,  now when we print this list you can see that the number 10 is placed at the beginning of the list and  all the other items are pushed to the right. Let's say we want to add an item at the beginning of our list, so we passed our index position  of 0, and then the second value is the actual  object we want to add to this list. So the index of 5 is 0. 50 is not in the list. So, we call index and pass a value here, like 5 and this returns the index of the first  occurrence of this item. So, let me show you we type our 15 in numbers,  earlier we used the in operator with a string, we check for the existence of a character or a sequence of a character in a string, now here we're checking for the existence of 50 in the list of numbers, so let's print this, we get a boolean value,  false, so unlike the index method, this expression,  doesn't generate an error, so it's safer to use this. if you want to check for the existence of an item in our list, you can call the index method. Take a look. Take a look. So, we call the sort method here, this method doesn't take any values so,  look at he return value, that is none, none is an object in python that represents the absence of a value. So this sort method doesn't really return any values it simply sorts this list, in place, so instead of printing the return value oft his method, we simply call it to sort our list and then print our list. We can also sort the items in descending order, so after we sort the list  we can call the reverse method. So if you make any changes to our original list, if you add new items to it, if you remove  existing items, these operations are not going to impact our second list. So let's define another variable called numbers 2,  now numbers 2, is a copy of our original list. So copy, with this method you can get a copy  of our list. We can add new items to a list, we can remove exxisitn items, we can check for the existence of an item, we can sort  our list, and copy them. So after we show you a copy of our numbers list let's add a new item to this list, so numbers.apphend  ten. If number not  in units so if we don't have an operator in this units list, then we'll need to add it, so units. So, for number  in numbers, now we need to check to see if we have this number in the second list. So we need to define another list let's call that new list. Then we need to iterate over our first list, get each item, and if we don't have that number in this unix list, then we'll add it to this second list. on our list. But unlike lists we can not modify them, we cannot add new items, we cannot remove existing items, we tuples are immutable. We only have two methods, count,  and index. Now we have a  tuple. So we can only get information about a tuple, we can't change it. look here we don't have the append or insert methods, so we cannot add new items to this tuple. If you want to create a list of items and make sure  no where in your program you accidentally modify that list, then it's better to use a tuple,  In this tutorial I'm going to show you a powerful feature So we cannot  mutate or change tuples, they are immutable. We get this type error, because the tuple object does not support item assignment. Now practically  speaking, most of the time you'll be using lists, but tuples are also useful. So similar to lists you can address individual items using squre bracketts,s o we can get the first item like this and then print another terminal, there you go, the first item is 1,  but if you try to change the first item we'll get an error, so,  numbers of 0, we set it to 10 and run our program  there you go. Now we started repeating coordinates of 2 or coordinates of 0 mult So together we'll have to write code like this, coordinates of 0, then let's say we want to multiply this by coordinates of 1, and then multiply it by coordinates  of 2, our code is getting a little bit too long, this is just a very simple example. So lets find a tuple called coordinates and here we pass 3 values, 1, 2, 3. And similarly we get coordinates of 2,  and then store it in z. But let's say we want to use these values in quite a few places  in our program, a better approach is to get these values and store them in separate variables like we can get coordinates of 0, and store it in x, then you can get coordinates of 1 and store it in y. So this is unpacking. And set them to our tuple. When Python interpreter sees this statement, it will get the first item in this tuple and assign it to the variable. But in Python we have a powerful feature called unpacking and with that we can achieve  the same result with far less code. Then it will get the second item in this tuple, then similarly we get the third item in this tuple and assign it to the third variable we have here, so we are unpacking this tuple into 3 variables. We use dictionaries in situations where we want to store information that comes as key value pairs. A customer has a bunch of attributes like name, email, phone number, address and so on. For example the name can be jon smith the email can be jon@ gmail.com the phone can be whatevr so what we have ere is a bunch of key value pairs. So in this example, our keys are name, email, and phone,  and each key is associated with a value. With a dictionary, we can store a bunch of key value pairs. So if I add another key value pair here,  set age to 40, now look pycharm has highlighted the age key, because we have duplicated that and that's not allowed. In this example we have an empty dictionary that doesn't have any key value pairs. So let's set age to  30 let's add another key value pair is  underline verified and we set this to a boolean. Now we can add one or more key value pairs in between the braces. So let's add a key value pair here, I'm going to set the key to a  name, and  the value to John Smith, then we add a comma, to add another key value pair. Now we can access each item in this dictionary  using square brackets. Also, if we spell name with let's say a capital N, we get the same error because we don't have a key with the exact same sequence of characters in this dictionary. You run the program, you get a key error because we don't have a key called birth date. So, we type customer,  square brackets and then specify key like name and this will return the value associated with the name key. Now to get around this we can use the get method, so instead of using the square brackets  we call the get method and specify the key Now if you use a key that doesn't Now with this line if  we print the name of this customer, we should see jack smith, let me show you. So, this is how we can access the value associated with the key in a dictionary. We can also update these values for example  before a print statement we can write code like this, customer of name, let's update the name to jack  smith, now this little warning is telling us here we can put jac smith here instead of defining it once, and then update it. Let's run the program  now instead of getting none we get this default value. So instead of getting a key error we get none and we can also option supply a default value, for example, if this dictionary doesn't have this key, we can supply the default value, let's say January 1st 1980. So here we have this program that asks our phone number. We type it in digits and then this will translate it, to words, take a look. Let's type 1 234. Alright, so first we need to get the users phone number, we call the input function  with the label phone, we get the result and store it in this variable, now let's say the user enters 123 4. se the square bracket notation again, let's print the name of the customer you can see that is updated here,  we can also add a new key here, let's set the birthdate to some value like january first 1980. So we cannot put digit 1 to the word 1 we can map 2  to two you get the point. is a dictionary, because a dictionary is a structure that allows us to a key to a value. And we map each of these keys to a word. So  4 character in phone, we get each character and then use it to access a key value pair in dictionary. So let's define  a dictionary, you can call it digits, underline mapping now this dictionary I'm going to add a few key value pairs. hod, so in case the user enters some character that is not part of our dictionary, our program is not going to yell at them. In this tutorial I'm going to show you something really cool that you can do with dictionaries, so here in this program you can type a message like good morning followed by a smiley face, when we press enter, we So, we type output, plus equals. Now finally let's print this output, run our program, so I want to type 1, 3,4, 5, lets  see what we get. So, we call the gt method and pass this character a the key, and if we don't have this key, we can supply a default value like exclamation mark, so with this we get a word now we need to add this word to an output string, so we can define an output string, initially we set it to an empty string,  in each iteration we get this and add it to our output string. get this beautiful smiley face, or we can type i am sad, with a  sad smiley face and it gets translated to this beautiful emoji. To do that we can call the split method. What this method does is basically it goes through this string and anywhere it finds this character, in this case a space, it uses it as a boundary to separate this string into multiple words. So we call message.split and pass  a string with one space as a separator. So lets go ahead and build this program together, we start by calling the input function, here we pass a greater than symbol as an indicator for the user to type a message, we give that message, store it here, as you know that is a string, now we need to split this string by a space, so if the user types good morning with a smiley face, we want to break this down into 3 words, good morning, and smiley face. So if you type good morning  sunshine, enter, we get a list with three items  each item is a string, okay? Let me show you. So let's store that here, words, and then Then print it on the terminal,  let's go ahead and run our program. list. So, we  have a list of words now we need to look through this list, get each word and pote So if a user types good morning, we don't want to translate those words, we just want to return those. So let's define that here,  output set it to an empty string, now back to line 9, we get the return value of the get method,  and add it to our output variable. So we can write a for loop for word in words,  now we want to go to our dictionary, and see if you have an item with this word as the key. So that is the case,  where we use the get method to supply a  default  value, so we wan to get an item with a key word, and if we don't have an item with that key, we simply use that word as  the default value. If you have an item with that key, we get it's value, otherwise we want to use the same word.  program and I'm going to type good morning sunshine with a smiley face, we get that  beautiful, let's try the sad face as well, I am sad. So function  is a container for a few lines of code that perform a specific  task for example you have learned about a few of the built in functions in python like print, and input, each of these functions  have a purpose, they know how to perform a specific task. Now so far we have been writing all our code right here, in app,py, but as our programs grow we need a better way to organize our code. We need to break up our code into smaller, more manageable  and more maintainable chunks which we call functions. So when we  build large complex programs, we should break up our code into smaller  reusable chunks which we call functions to better organize our code. So we're going to do a print,  hi there, and lets add another message  welcome aboard. So here we have a simple  program with only two lines of code. When Python interpreter sees this it knows that we're defining a function, next we need to give our function  a name, lets say greet_user. So let's write this simple  program, for printing a greeting message. Now let's say these two lines  potentially we're going to need them in other programs so we can put them in a function that we can reuse. And finally let's do another create statement and print finish. fine a function called greet user, after that we'll need to add parenthesis  followed by a colon. So I'm going to move these two lines these two print statements inside of our function. You can simply  press tab to indent them, beautiful, also lets remove this extra line break, that is better, so these two lines now are part of our greet user function, so whenever we  call this function, these two lines will be executed. Now,  let's remove indentation so here we are outside of our function,  let's do a print statement and print start after that let's call our function, so greet user. So for now to make pycharm happy, lets add an extra line break to this function so whenever we define a function we need to add two lines breaks after. was telling you that we should add two blank lines after a function definition. Okay? Okay? So let me explain the flow of our program  when python runs this code it doesn't actually print these two messages on the terminal because these two lines of code are inside of this function, so they would only get executed if we call this function. Then, it will jump out of this function and continue the normal execution of our program so it will print the finish message on the terminal. Also note that the order of this code matters, so here we're calling the greet function after after we have defined it. Here's a function we created in the last tutorial now I got a question for you, what is the difference between calling this functions After that, Python sees that we are calling the greet function, so it will jump over here and then execute these two lines. So we always define our functions first, and then  call them. So let's pass Jon here, now when we call this function and pass this value this name parameter will be set to Jon. So,  in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to pass information to your functions, and  that is pretty easy, so back to the definition of our greet user function, inside of these parenthesis, we can add parameters these parameters are pale holders for receiving information. Wouldn't it be nicer if you could pass the name of the user here and then instead of saying hi there, you could print the name of the user. The difference  is that the print function takes some information, in this case  the message that we want to print, but our greet function doesn't take  any information. For example, you can add a name parameter, and we can pass the name of the user when calling this function. So we are reusing our greet function and passing it a different value. So  greet user, and this time supply a different name. Imagine if we didn't have this function you would have to  repeat this line twice , once for hi jon and another time for hi mary. So this is the benefit of defining functions, we can take a few lines of code that have a specific purpose and put them inside of a  function, so now let's run our program one more time Now we can call this function one more time. So if you remove jon from here and run  our program, we get this type error, greet user,  missing one required positional argument. But they are not, parameters are the holes or placeholders that we define in our function for receiving information,  arguments are the actual pieces of information that we supply to these functions. So, let's bring back  this jon string, now we can also define multiple  parameters, for example, let's rename this parameter to first name as I told  you before, you can right click here, go to refac Now note that when a function has a parameter  we are obligated to pass a value for that parameter. Argument in programming is the value that we supply to a function, so back to this example, marrying this case is an argument that we pass to the name parameter. Let's look at that error one more time. Run our program, we get this message,  greet user missing one required, position  argument. So these arguments that you have here like jon  and smith you refer to these as positional arguments. So In going to delete this second argument and only pass jon. Now we can add a second parameter  so comma followed by last underline name  so back to our formatted string, let's also print  the last name, beautiful, so here when calling this function,  then we can supply another argument so jon smith and lets delete this line we don't really need it anymore  run our program, take a look, hi jon smith,  so in the last tutorial you learned that whenever  we define parameters for our functions we should always supply  values otherwise we'll get an error. In other words, the first argument we add here is the value or the first parameter  and the second argument is the value for the second parameter. So this combination of having the parameter name, followed by it's value is what we call a keyword argument, and what we get wi Now what we have here is a keyword argument. So,  let's say here you want to pass Jon as the value for the first  name parameter. Let's pass smith first and then jon. Most of the time we use positional arguments, but in certain situations these keyword arguments helming us improve  the readability of our code. th this keyword argument the position doesn't really matter. Now in this particular example, even if we didn't have the keyword arguments, just passing two positional arguments like jon  and smith, would be sufficient, because it's easy to guess what is the purpose of these arguments. Now that doesn't mean we should always use keyword arguments. Now similarly,  we can use a keyword argument for smith, so last name equals smith, so that we have 2  keyword arguments. Now if you give this code to someone else, they can immediately tell what these values represent. Let's say we have a function for calculating the total cost of an order,  so we still call that calculate, underline cost,  so when calling this function, you need to supply three pieces of information. One is the total cost of all the order items lets say 50 dollars. Someone reading this code, may not be sure  what these three values represent, in this case, we can improve the readability of this code, by using keyword arguments. The other is the shipping cost, let's say  5 dollars, and the last piece is discount, let's say 0,  .1. So when calling this function we're supplying one keyword argument  and one positional argument, and python doesn't like this. So we immediately get this error and  positional argument after keyword argument. So,  back to our simple greet user function, let's use a keyword argument  for the first thing. These keyword arguments should always come after positional arguments. So,  if you're mixing positional and keyword arguments, you should always use and then the keyword arguments. So far you have learned how to create functions and send them information using their parameters in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to create functions that return  values, this is particularly useful if you're doing some kind of calculation your function and you want to return the result to whoever is using your function. itional argument, is targeting the first parameter. So let's quickly recap, for the most part use positional arguments  if you're dealing with functions that take multiple numerical values  and it's not quite clear what those values represent, use keyword arguments  to improve the readability of your code, and finally if your passing both positional and keyword arguments, use the keyword arguments after the positional arguments. Now after this positional argument we can supply any number of keyword arguments, so if you set last name to smith look, python doesn't have any problem with this because we are adding  a keyword argument after a positional argument. So, with this, when we call the square function,  let's say we give it 3, now this function returns a value,  just like an input function of python, this input function  waits for the user to type something and press enter and then it will return the user's input as a string so we can get it and store it in a variable like this, right? So now we can return values to the caller of our function. So return. So let's start by defining a  function, called square, this function simply calculates the square of a number. Now to return this color outside of this function we simply  use the return statement. We simply want to print  the square of 3. So our square function returns the value we can simply get it and store it in a variable. Now, we can print  result on the terminal, there you go, so result is 9,  we could also pass this function called directly inside of the print function without defining a separate variable. So, we could simply pass this function  call right here, as an argument for the print  function. So let's delete this variable now our code is shorter so with this we're calling the square function, this returns a  value and we'll pass that value as an argument to the print function.  a print statement. Let's temporarily remove  this return statement and print the result on the terminal. So if we don't have a return statement  here, by default python returns none. So, after this square function is executed, the value none  is returned and passed as an argument to the print function, that is the So, in this example, we didn't have a return statement, and  by default python returned none from this function. You can change that, so if you have a function that  calculates something, you can return the result using the return statement. Now, your exercise is to reorganize this code using a function. Here's the code for our emoji converter program that we wrote earlier. So we can simply click on the emoji converter tutorial to watch it. So I want you to extract a function in this code, because this algorithm for converting these smiley faces into emoji's is something that we probably want to use in a couple different applications. You want to give our function the actual message,  as a string. By the same function, you shouldn't include the last line So that is the reason this line up code should not be in that function. We don't want to put that in our function, because this line will not be reuseable. So, you should put these lines in a separate function,  Now, why don't we have the input in this function? Each function should be responsible for one and only one task,  and that task should be clearly explained in the name of the function. Alright, on the top, first we need to define our function. Colon now we need to move the lines  5 all the way to the end of our for block  into the function, so l So first we type  def, give our function a name like emoji_ converter, so the name of this function clearly tells me what it does.  in that function because what we do with the output is different from  one program to another. et's select all these lines, you can cut them from here, by pressing command and x on Mac, or control and x on Windows, then we paste it here,  as you can see these lines are automatically indented  so, they are part of the emoji converter function, if this didn't happen on your computer, make sure to select these lines and use the  tab to indent them. Now after that  in the main flow of our program, first we get the input from the user  we store it in this variable message and then we call emoji converter and pass this message,  this function should return a value, that is what we use to calculate the end of this function, so right after this for block we need to add  a return statement, return output,  now that our function returns a value, we can get it and store it in a separate variable, let's call that result  and then we can simply print that here, or we can make this code shorter, we don't really need this code here so Alright, so here's our emoji converter function  beautiful.  we can simply  call the emoji converter, and print the result. Now here we have an underline because as I told you before we need to blank lines after our function definitions. Like this. So we call the input variable  input, and a label here,  like age, this returns a string, so we need to pass it to the end funciton and store the result in a variable called age, So currently we have only one blank line  we need to add another black line, good, let's go ahead,  and run this program, and make sure everything works as before  so I'm going to type a message like good morning with a smiley face  good, let's run it one more time, times that,  to add okay beautiful, so, here's the final result, we defined this function called emoji converter, this function takes a parameter called message. We get a value error with his message invalid literal  for int with base 10. So instead of letting the program  crash you should handle the situation and print a proper You don't want to let your entire program crash just because the user entered  an invalid value. Now look at the exit code of this program, exit code 1 means our exit code crashed,  so 0 always means success and anything but 0 means crash  now as a good python programmer you should anticipate this situation. now let's print age to make sure you have implemented everything properly we run our program, we type  20, 20 is printed here, beautiful, now look at  the exit code of this program, exit code 0 means our program terminated successfully, there were no errors, but what if we run this program one more time and instead of entering  a numerical value, we enter something like asd. And remove this black line, now these two lines are part of our try block, right? So on the top we type try: now as you know we are defining  a code block so, I'm going to move these two lines,  inside of our try block so press tab here.  error message, and  that's what I'm going to show you in this tutorial, now before we get any further  look at the type of error we get here, value error,  so remember this, we're going to get back to this shortly  now how can we handle these errors, in python we have a construct called  try accept we use that to handle errors. Then, we add a colon and in this block we can define what should happen if our program encounters  an error of type value error. So after try we type  accept, and then we add the type of the error  that our program may encounter, that is value error okay? Now more accurately in programming we reefer to this kind of error as an exception. So our user enters an invalid value, this line of code  in line 2 will raise an exception, and on line 4 will catch it and print this error message, so our program will no longer  crash. Value error  then instead of crashing the program, try this error message on the terminal so this is how this works. So an exception  is a kind of error that crashes our program. So let's go ahead and run this age 20, everything  works just like before and the exit code is 0, let's  rerun this program, and enter asd,  so we get this proper error message invalid error menu and once again  the exit code is 0, so that means our program completed successfully. Let's run this program and enter 0 as the game to see what happened. Once again look at the exit code, so we couldn't catch this kind of error or this kind of exception with this accept block. Now,  I'm going to enter 0 as the age so we get this error message age cannot be 0 Accept block is only cashing exceptions of type value error. Now in this block we can print a  different kind of message, like age cannot be 0. Now, before that, I  can add a comment using a hi sign and then whatever we type here  is going to get ignored it's not going to get executed. In this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about comments in python. These are good use cases for using comments, we can al For example, here I'm going to make a print statement,  sky is blue. We use comments to add notes or comments to our programs. Now the problem with this comment is that apart from being verbose and repetitive, if you come here,  and change sky to ocean, now this comment gets  outdated. So here's an example of a bad comment. Let me just delete these two lines, and with this comment I'm going to say print sky is blue. So I've seen some developers  add comments in front of their functions, for example, they define  a function let's say a square that takes a number  and simply returns number times number. Why is this a bad comment, because it's telling me the obvious, it's telling me  this slide is going to print sky is blue. In this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about classes in python. Not why's if you have made certain assumptions, we can use comments to explain those assumptions. Or we can use them to add notes to remind yourself  or other developers to do something in the code. We use classes to define new types. Someone else reading your code they get distracted with all these unnecessary comments, so use comments to explain whys and hows. n  about a couple of complex types like lists and  dictionaries. So we can use classes to define new types to  model real concepts. Now in this new model I'm going to show you how to define a new type called point, and this new type is going to have methods  for working with points. While these types are extremely useful, they cannot  always be used to model complex concepts, for example, think about  the concept of a point, or a shopping cart. Let's  create a list, numbers, 1, 2, 3,  you know that here, when we type that dot,  functions or methods available in list objects, now similar to this,  we're going to create a new type called point, this point is going to have metas like move, draw, get,  distance from another point, these are the operations that we can perform on points. But when naming classes, we don't use an underscore  to separate multiple words, instead we capitalize  the first letter of every word. So in this case our class has only a single  word, if you had multiple words, let's say email client  look I've capitalized the first letter of every word. Now look at the naming convention I've used here. So the naming convention we  used for naming our classes is different from the convention we use for naming our variables and functions. I've capitalized the first letter here, this is what we call a pascal naming convention. So we can have tens of hundreds of points on the screen, these are the objects or the instances.  define all the functions or methods that belong  to points, for example, we can define a function called  move for moving a port, now note that as soon as we type open parenthesis, pycharm automatically adds self here,  this is a special keyword and we're going to get back to this shortly. So to create an object, we type out So, for now, in this method, let's print  move on the terminal, now let's define another  method like draw, so define draw  and in this method, let's print draw on the terminal, now let's remove the indentation, we're done  with the definition of our point class, so we need to add two line breaks  okay, so with this class we defined a new  type with this new type we can create new objects, so an object is an instance of a class, a class simply defines  the blueprint or the template for creating objects, and  objects are the actual instances based on that blue print. So then we can store that object in a variable, let's call that point 1,  there you go, now when we use the dot operator. Now apart from methods these objects can also have attributes and these attributes are like variables that belong to a particular object. Now we can create another object, let's call that.2  so .2 once again we Now we can easily print out these attributes, let's print  .1.x and run our program one more time take a look, so the x coordinate of .1 is 10. Now, let's call the draw method  of our point object, and run our program  so you can see draw is printed on the terminal. So to recap we use classes to define new types, these types can have  methods that we define in the body of the class and they can also  have attributes that we can set anywhere in our programs. Now this object is completely  different then the first object. We can create a pooint object without an x or y coordinate let me show you. So point we create this object here, and before we set point.x let's print point .x run our program  we get this attribute error which you saw in the last tutorial, so point objec So if you print  .2.x  look we get this attribute error, because this point object doesn't have an attribute called, so each object is a different  instance of our points class. We need to add a special method in this class called constructor. So here on line 9, when creating this point object, we want to pass values for x or y  coordinates, let's say 10 and 20, and with this,  this point object that we get here, will have it's x and y coordinates initialized. t has no attribute called x This is the problem we have here, it is possible,  to have a point object without an x or y coordinates. A constructor is a function that gets called at the time of creating an object. So init is short for initialized, and this is the function or the method that gets called when we create a new point object. Now what we have in the constructor is exactly the same, we use the self  to reference the current object and then we set the x attribute  to the x argument passed to this function. So earlier we typed point.x equals 10,  with this code we set the x attribute of this point object. What is going on here, this self that you see here is a reference to the current  object. Self.x equals  x. And then self.y equals y. so, Now, let's remove line 14, so we created point object with these values and then print point.x let's run our program  there you go, x is 10, we can also change  these values later, so just before printing point.x we can set  point.x to 11 and then run our program  so x is updated, beautiful, alright, here's a  exercise for you. we can initialize our objects and  we refer to this method as a constructor, this method is used to construct  or create an object, okay? Alright, so first we start with a  class keyboard, we define this person class  once again look at the naming convention I have used here, the first letter of the first word in this case the only word is uppercase. Now, in this class we define all the methods we need, currently we only have method that is the talk met I want you to define a new type called person these person objects should have a name attribute as well as a talk method. Once again, self references the current object, we're setting the name  attribute of the current object, to the name argument passed to this method. talk, let's run the program so we get this message, beautiful, but our person objects should also have a name attribute, it doesn't make sense to have a person without the name. Now we can create the personal object, let's call that jon,  we set it to person, we can call jon. Now in this method we need to add another parameter which is name, so we  simply set self.name to name. So we call this method a constructor. And they should be the very first parameter of each method, okay? Well, look at  the parameter of this talk method. As I told you before,  every method in our class should have this parameter, self. Instead of printing this boring message here, let's print hi, I am Jon Smith. e 9, and  when creating a person object we pass the name, let's see jon smith  now let's print jon.name and run our program  there you go. Sow e'll have to repeat all that code,  in this new class, walk. Now, what if in the future we want to define a  another class let's say cat and we want to add  this walk method there as well. And run our program  we get a different message, hi I'm Bob Smith, so each object is a different instance of a person class. Now we can build another person object, let's say Bob, is a new person  called Bob Smith, when we say  Bob.talk. Let's say we have this dog class with a simple walk method, in this method we're simply printing the walk message on the terminal, now let's say in real program, instead of just one line of code here we're going to have 10 lines of code.  repeated or duplicated our code. Let's say sometime in the future, we discover a problem with our walk method. That' exactly the same, so on the top, we define a new class, let's call it mammal then we need to move the walk method there. We define a new class called maml and move the walk method right there. If you have repeated or duplicated this method in many other places, then we'll  have to come back and fix that problem in every single place we have duplicated this code. The reason this is happening is because python doesn't like an empty class, so right now our dog class is empty, it doesn't have anything, we either need to add methods specific to dogs or just to make Python happy,  we can use the path statement, and that basically means nothing. But with this, we don't have an empty class, okay? Now as I told you before after each class I should have two line breaks so right now we  only have one line break and that is So with his the dog class will inherit all he methods defined in the mammal class. d and x on Mac, or control x on Windows and then paste it here, beautiful,  now we want our dog class to inherit this class from the mammal class so right after the class name we add parenthesis and  then type out the name of the parent class. look we have two methods one is the walk method that we inherited and the ba We can easily call it, let's run our program there you go, you see the walk message,  so both the dog and cat classes are inheriting all the classes methods defined in their parent class.  the reason we have this little warning here, so let's add another black line, beautiful, so our dog class is inheriting the walk method from the mammal, you need to apply the same change  to the cat class. With these changes,  now we can create either a dog or  cat object, let's say dog,  one, we set it to a dog object, and  when we type dot look we have the walk method that is defined  in the mamall class. Now, we don't need the path statement because we already defined  one method in our dog class. If you're interested to learn more about inheritance and other mechanisms  for reusing code, I encourage you to get my complete Python course. When you go to a super market there are different sections for fruits, vegetables, cleaning products, and so on. A module in python is basically a file with some python code. In this tutorial, I'm going to talk to you about modules in python. Just like sections in a super market. So instead of writing all our code, instead of writing all the functions and classes in app.py we want to break up our code into multiple files. converters.py. Now we can take these two functions and put them in a separate module called converters, and then we can import that module into any program that needs these converter functions. So, let's open up our project panel and right click the project, go to new, and add the new file,  we're going to call this file, converters.py. Then, we go back to app.py  select all this code, cut it and then  paste it into our new module. So we can easily call one of these functions  let's pass 70 kilos get the result and print it out. So currently we have defined  these two functions inside of our module, kilogram to pound,  and pounds to kilograms. ated with different functions, so as we write more functions with classes, we put them in their  corresponding modules, a module should contain all the related functions and classes, okay? Now you want to import the converters module into our app module, and that is really easy, on the top we write import converters  without extension, so we don't add .py we only type out the name of the file. Now there is also another syntax for importing modules, let me show you, so instead of importing the entire module we can import specific functions from that  module. and then we'll be able to access this function. So here we can grab one of these functions let's say kilogram to pound, and  with this we can directly call this function just like the function defined in this file.  the name of our module, so converters  import, now here if you press control and space we can see the list of all the functions defined in this module. When we import  a specific function from our module, then we can easily call that function without prefixing it with the module name. On line 6 we'll have to prefix this function with the name of an object  converters. So here on the top we have a list of numbers, initially we set max to the first number in this list then, we look through this list, get each number,  if the current number is grater than max, then we reset max. The other appraoch is to impot a specific function or class from a module using the from import statement. Earlier in the course you had an exercise for finding the largest number in the list. then we can import a module into another module, in this case, we are importing  the converters module into our app module. And as you saw,  there are two ways to import this module, we can import the entire module, and then we'll get an object with the same name as the module so we can type converters . So, as part of this exercise, I want  you to write a function, call it find max. So the first step is to define a function called find max. Then import the utility  module into the current module and call this function. Now after you do this, go ahead and put this function  in a separate module. So on the top, I'm going to define function, find max this function should take a list of numbers Alright, so we find the largest number in this list, finally we need to return it, so,  return max. So somewhere in our program we're going to create this list,  and tehen pass it as an argument to pass max  function. So here's our function. Now inside of this function you want to have these few lines, this is the algorithm for finding the  largest number in a list, we don't want to bring the first line, because this is where we create a list. So, let's go ahead and grab these few lines, cut them, and put them inside of find max function. Then, we pass that list as an argument to find max we get the result which is max and finally we print it on the terminal. Now I'm going o go back to app.py and import our new module. Now we need to call this after we initialize our list. So, we could type from utils import find max. We can either import the entire module, so import utils  and then access individual functions so we can call utils  .find max or we can explicitly  import this function from the utils module. And this is the color used to identify the built in functions. Look at the color of max here, it's purple, it's the same color as print. And it does the exact same job  as our find max function. Now, back to the warning, this warning is basically telling us that we are overwriting the built in max function in python  so we are changing the meaning of this function, and this is considered a bad practice,  let me show you what I mean. So now we can call this function and give it a list of numbers  run our program we get the same exact result however,  if we bring this line back, once again we can use the same  shortcut that is command and slash on Mac o So there you go,  we get this type error, int object is not  callable, because max is now an integer, it's not a function,  so we cannot call it. So to solve this problem, we can rename  this variable to something else. So,  let's rename these as well, I'm going to use the short cut that is shift and  f6 there you go and here we can change this to  maximum. Go to refactor and rename,  and rename this to maximum. Now, we are redefining max, so up to this line, max used to be a function, but after line 4 is executed  max is set to an integer, that is the largest number in this list. When you go to a  mall or a shopping center there are different  sections for mens women and kids clothing, so that is ilke a package, now when you go to the mens section, there are different areas fior different kinds of products, we have a section for shoes, t shirts,  jackets, and so on, so each of these is like a modul ial we're going to talk about packages in python,  packages are basically another way to organize our code, so currently we have only 3 files for modules in our project but a real project  can contain hundreds or even thousands of modules. So in our project we can add a new directory  and in that directory we can add all the directed modules, as a metaphor think of a mall. We don't want to add all those modules here, because over time this directory will get  bloated with so many files, so a better approach is to organize related  modules, inside of a package, so a package is a container  for multiple modules In file system terms a package is  a directory or folder. Let's call this directory e commerce. So let's go ahead  Now here we have an empty directory, in order to convert this to a package  we need to add a special file in it. So, right click this directory and add a new python file,  call that file double underscore in it, double underscore  this is a special convention in Python. e, so,  in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create and use packages in Python,  here in our project panel, right click the panel and add a new directory. When Python interpreter sees a file with this name and  name in a directory, it treats this directory as a package, we also have a  shortcut for that in pycharm so let me delete this directory  and start again. ut instead of creating a new directory  we can create a new python package, let's call our package ecommerce as you can see  pycharm automatically creates this file for us so we don't have to manually create it. So,  bak to app,py once again there are two ways to import this module. We can import the entire module or we can  import one of it's functions or classes. Now, in this package, let's add a new module,  so a new python file, let's call it shipping okay? Now lets say you want to import this shipping module  into our app module, with this new structure this shipping  module is now part of the ecommerce package, so we cannot import a direct  you have to start from the ecommerce package. So instead of typing import  shipping we type import ecommerce  .shipping. Now to access any of the functions or classes in this module  we'll have to type out ecommerce.shipping. shipping. shipping. So we can type from ecommerce  .shipping import  calculate shipping. Or we can import the entire module and then  access all he functions or classes in that module. Like calculate shipping. Now the shipping module,  is an object so we can access  all the functions and classes defined here, using the dot operator, so shipping. there you go, calculate shipping. To import the entire module  we type from ecommerce so we remove.shipping  so from this package, import  the shipping module.  with python, and I'm going to show you that later in this course. So here we search for python 3  module index, and the first p So make sure to watch the tutorials,  about modules and packages one more time, otherwise you're going to get confused later  when we get to Django. In this tutorial I'm going to talk to you  guys about the built in modules in python, so python  comes with a standard library that contains several modules for common tasks such as sending emails, working with date and time,  generating random values and passwords and so on. So open up this browser and search for python 3, module index,  make sure to add the version number, because the modules in python 2 are different from modules in python3. So on the top, we import the random module, now because random is a built in module, we don't need to have a file here Everybody knows some modules based on the applications they have built. So in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to use one of the built in modules,  for generating random values. This is not something that you need to learn right now, as you learn python  as you build more applications, gradually you will get familiar with more modules here, in fact nobody knows all the modules in python standard library. age here, you can see is python module index, or python 3, let's go ahead,  so these are all the modules built into python,  for example we have modules for working with date and time,  we have modules for sending emails for encoding values,  there are so many modules here. So python interpreter knows that random is a built  in module as long as it knows where to find it. Now in this tutorial,  we don't want to worry about hat, so let's go back to our app.py, and use this module to generate random values. called random.py. So random. The random module. If we run our program one more time,  We get different values, so 20, 19, 11, one more time. Let's say we have a list of team member We can look through this range object  and in each iteration this object will spit out a value. Let's say random values between 10 and 20, well,  there is another method here, rand int, we use 2 arguments here to specify our range, let's say 10 and 20. So here we can do a for loop,  let's say for I in,  range 3. I want you to write this program to  roll a dice. s and you want to randomly pick someone as the leader. So every time we run this program we get a different value. Now we have 3 in 1, next time we get 3 and 6, one more time  5 and 6, 4 and 3, double one, that's a very cool exercise. let's run our program,  so now the leader is mary, if you run our program one more time this line is mosh now it's mosh again one more time,  it really likes mosh, you get the point. Alright, we start by importing the random module on the top,  then we define a class called dice: this class we want to have a method called row. So define row  parenthesis, this automatically adds self, now in this method,  you want to generate two random values between 1 to 6. ice  in this class we're going to have a method called rope so every time we call this method, we get a tuple, a tuple remember is a list of  values but values cannot be changed, you cannot add a new item to it, we cannot remove it. With two random values, f So every time,  we call the row method, we should get the tuple of two random values. We have so many python enhancement proposals or peps. inally we need to return them,  in a tuple, so return parenthesis instead of square brackets,  first and second, now  in python when you want to return a python from a  function, you don't have to add this parenthesis, so you can simplify your code and python will automatically  interpret this as a tuple. Pep 8 is a very famous 1, and in this document we have  all the best practices for formatting our code. So pep 8 Once again this is coming from pep 8, pep is short for python and  proposal. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to work with directories in python. So here in python3,  module index, you can see we have a module called path lib which provides an object  oriented file system pact. Now you don't have to memorize  any of these best practices, as you code in pycharm, pycharm gives you a little more warning, and gradually you will learn how to properly format your code, so it's readable by other people. So basically pycharm is following all the best  practices defined in pep8. That basically means it provides classes that we can use to create objects to work with directories and  files. Now we need to create,  a path object to reference a file or directory  on our computer. Okay, so look, from path lib, that's our module, import path, note the naming convention. So there are basically to ways to do this we can use an absolute path, or a relative path which basically  means a path starting from the current directory. So after pycharm  on the top, from the path led module, that's import the path class. n see this is how we import the path class from the path lib module. On Windows we use a backslash to build a path. For example, if you're on Windows you might have  an absolute path like this, c drive, backslash,  program, files, backslash microsoft,  so these are directories in c drive. In this tutorial we're going to work with he relative path to work with this ecommerce  directory that we have in our project. So, let's close this panel,  we create a path object, now,  if you don't pas an argument here, this will reference the current directory alternatively, we can pass string, in this string we can add a file or a directory. let's say the ecommerce  directory. This simply returns a boolean so let's print it on the terminal,  there you go. Now if you look at the project panel you can see here we have a new directory called emails, we can also delete this directory  so, instead of mk dir we call  rmdir which is short for remove directory, but  let's go ahead, now we can see that directory is gone. his path object has a few interesting methods  for example, we can check to see if a path exists by calling  the exist method. Let's run our program alright, this method returns none which basically means  it doesn't return any values. So this path exists,  what if it changes to ecommerce 1, and  run our program and get false, we can also create a new directory  for example, let's change our path to email, now when we  run this program, obviously we don't have this directory but we can  create it by calling the mk dir method  so make directory. First we change the path to the current directory and then we call the glob  method. We can also search for all the py files, or all the excel  spreadsheets. With this  pattern, we'll only get the files in the current directory. With his method we cans each for files and  directories in the current path. So let's search for all the py files  in the current directory, now when we run our program  we get this generator object.  for now all you need to know is we can iterate  or loop through these generator objects. So don't worry if the files you see here are different on your machine. So instead of  printing this generator object, let's just iterate over it using  a for loop, so, for, file in,  the generator object that is returned from the glob method. So, you can use the glob method to search for files using  a pattern, we can also get all the files and directories in the current  path, so, we just use one asterisk, then run our program, take a look,  so we have this ecommerce directory, we have notes.txt, this is a file I  added earlier just to write notes as part of my presentation so you're not going So these are all the py files in my current directory, this could be different on your machine if you didn't follow the exercises I gave you earlier. Of course not every package, not every p And in this directory you can find hundreds  of packages for doing awesome things. So that's why we have a fantastic community in python,  there are so many python developers out there and there are so many packages  right in front of us to reuse in our programs, let's say you want to send text messages in your programs, you don't have to build this functionality from scratch,  we can simply come to pypi.org and  search for sms aas you can see there are so many  projects or apckages that give you this functionality. These are packages that people like you and I have built as part of our projects, and then they have published it as part of this directory. That's why we have this directory called python package  index. So you can write a program and search for businesses  registered on Yelp. This is the same technique that Google does to index various websites. For example you will learn how to access the information on yelp.com in your programs. You will also learn how to use a technique called  web scraping, which means you can build an engine and have that engine  browse a website, and extract information from HDML files. So they have several engines, or web crawlers, these web crawlers  are continuously looking at various websites and extracting information  from their pages. You can automate all that  with a powerful python package called selenium, as I have shown in my complete, as I show in my complete python course. So,  I'm going to show you how to do that with Python, we'll also look at browser automation, and this is extremely  powerful, because you can automate testing of your web applications. So let's search for this package, there you go, so currently  it's at version 2.5. Now in this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to install packages, from pypi.org. So,  here on pypi.org let's search for open py xl. You can open up a terminal window for executing  various commands. mand that we need to type in the terminal window to install this package into our program, so back to pycharm,  here on the status bar. So here,  we're using pip to install this package. open py  xl. So pip install open py xl Make sure to spell everything properly. al libraries, next expand python 3, and then expand sight packages. So as you can see, this package openpyxl has several subpackages like cell, start, chart sheet and so on. So here we have open py xl, you can open this,  in this folder we have another folder called cell, now Now, look what we have here you have this init type, earlier I told you that whenever we add this file to a folder, python treats that folder as a package, so sell is a package, and this package we have is modules. Next we're going to work on our first python projec And in each package we have several modules, in the next tutorial I will show you how to work with excel files. In this tutorial I'm going to show you something really awesome you can do with python. So in this spreadsheet we're going to record all kinds of transactions, but let's say due to an error, You're going to  learn how to process spreadsheets, and this is extremely valuable in situation where you have hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets that need to be updated. And have that python program, automatically process thousands of spreadsheets in under one second. You're going to write a python program that can process thousands of spreadsheets in under a second. The price that we have here is wrong. have to get that and then multiply it by 0.9 and that is like 90% of the original price, we are reducing the original reducing the price by 10%. It's going to auotmate this process and not only that it will also add this beautiful chart right here,  once again if you want to open up hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets  and add Next we'll have to come back here, select this cell and apply the same formula to all the other rows. If you want to do this manually, we'll have to come back here and  add a formula, so we typed out equal sign, let's say you want to recalculate say you want to recalculate the value of this cell. Now,  here on the top, first we need to import the open py excel package. Alright the first thing I want you to do is to download this transactions file and add it to your project. So import open py excel, we can give it a  an alias to make our code shorter. So, let's get started. Let me show you. Now if you open this workbook, you can see you add only 1 sheet, and that is called sheet 1, so to access that you use  square brackets, and specify the name of the sheet,  that is sheet one, make sure to spell this with a capital  S. Because this is case sensitive, if you don't spell it properly  you're going to get an error, so this returns a sheet,  now in this sheet, we have various cells. So this we load our excel workbook and return a workbook object. okay so that's an alias for this package. Now in this package we have a function for loading an xl  workbook. back to py charm, with this sheet object, you can use  square brackets and give the coordinate of a cell. So we need to add a for loop. Also, there is another approach to getting a cell, instead of using square brackets with a string, we can use the cell method of the sheet object, so,  sheet.cell, you pass the row and the column, so row  and column 1 these return the exact same  cell. So,  let's delete this print statement, nd add a for loop  for row in were Now let's print the value of this cell, cell.value and run our program so  the value is transaction id, beautiful,  so now we need to iterate over all these rows and for each row we need to get the value  in the third column. Let's print this, so in this sheet,  we have 4 row, and you can verify that here. Back here, you want to change  our range function, and start from 2. Now,  we're going to use sheet.cell to ge Let's go over here,  so we tied sheet.max underline row plus 1. So currently  max row returns 4, if you use range of 1-4 this will generate  the numbers 1, 2, and 3, but not 4.  going to use the range function unction to generate a range of numbers,  starting from 1, all the way to sheet  .max_grow. Once again, this returns a cell object, let's store that in a  separate variable and call it price_cell. And the column should be 3. t access to the cell at this row. Next we need to multiply each value by 0.9 so instead of printing  cell.value we multiplied by 0.9 and this is the corrected underline price,  so this is the mistake we're going to make with our program, now we need to add a new cell to our worksheet, so we want to add all the corrected prices, ia  new column, it could also overwrite the values in this column,  but in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to add a new column. So using the same method, now we need to get a reference to the cell, to the given  row, but in the fourth column. With these few lines  we can easily update our spreadsheet, but first we need to save it. Next we have to set the value in this cell. value to this corrected price. You have corrected price which holds actual value and we have corrected price, which is a cell object in this spreadsheet. So we set corrected price cell. s import statement let's type out from  open py excel.chart, import, bar chart,  comma, reference. For this exercise, I'm going to select the values in the fourth column/. First we need to select a range  of values. Now in this part 2 example it doesn't really make sense to add a chart per transaction, but that doesn't really matter we just want a bunch of numbers to create a chart, so after our for loop, we're going to use the reference class to select a range of values. So all the values in rows 2-4 these are the values I'm going to use in our chart. That's not what we want. So we pass our sheet here, then we add 4 keyword arguments, the first one is min_row, we set this to 2. The second one is max_row we set this to the maximum row in this sheet. we only want the values in the fourth column, so back here we need to set a couple more key word arguments men_call or column, we set that to for, and also  max underline call, we set that to 4 as well. That is sheet,  .max_row, so we want to select the cells in row 2-4. kay? let's say we want to add it here, on row 2, after the fourth column. Next, we call chart.add_date and  pass our values. So as the coordinate I'm going to pass e2 that's all we had to do, done. So the coordinate of this cell is e2, and this is going to be,  the top left corner of our chart. So, we call sheet,  .add_chart and pass this chart object  We should also specify where we want to add this chart. So let's goo ahead and organize this code like a professional software developer. We have written all the code in app.py. program is complete, for our code is dirty, it's not clean, it's not  organized. So we want o reorganize this code So,  let's delete these unnecessary lines, this is a very important practice as you're coding always look at your code, always review it, see if you have some code that is not used. , and  move it inside of a function. Earlier in this python course you learned  how to find all the files in a  directory, so we can get each file in a directory  and pass the name of the file to this function, this function will go ahead and update this spreadsheet in just a second or less. Now, we move all the code inside  of this function, so let's select everything, and press tab, beautiful, now back to our function, instead of loading this transactions file we're going to load this file name, that's better,  Also, now that our program is working properly, there is really no need to store the result in a separate file. So let's pass file name, that is the end of our function, so,  now, we have this reusable function, we can simply reuse this to process thousands of spreadsheets. This function should take the name of a function So let's define a function. Use the comment box below and let me know. Here's a question for you, what do you want to automate, how do you want to use python to make your life easier? If you want to build this program using traditional programming techniques, your program is going to get overly complex  You will h Next we're going to work on  project which involves machine learning, which is a  subset of artificial intelligence. In this section, you're going to learn about machine learning, which is a subset of AI or artificial intelligence. Then you would have to rewrite them. That's not going to work. ave to come up with lots of rules to come up with specific curves edges and colors in an image to tell if it's a cat or a dog. But if I give you a black and white photo, your rules may not work, they may break. Cats, dogs, and horses, once again you will have to rewrite  all those rules. And this involves tasks such as duplicated data. Next we'll look at machine  learning in action. So that's the basic idea about machine learning. You might have a database with lots of data,  we can simply export that data and store it in a csv file for the purpose of our machine learning project. A machine learning project involves  a number of steps, the first step is to import our data which often comes in the form of a csv file. Now that we have a clean data set, we need to split it into two segments. If there is data that is irrelevant we should remove them, if there are duplicates or incomplete we can remove or modify them, if our data is  text based, like the name of countries, or genres of music,  or cats and dogs, we need to convert them to numerical values. The next step is to create a model, and this involves selecting  an algorithm to analyze the data. One for training our model, and the other for testing it, to make sure our model produces the right result. ta, we don't want to feed this to the model, because otherwise our model will learn bad patterns in our data and will produce the wrong result,  so we should make sure that our input data is in a good, and clean shape. Each algorithm have pros and cons in terms of accuracy and performance  so the algorithm you use, depends on the kind of problem you're trying to solve and your input data. So we need to envalue the prediction So we build a model using an algorithm ,  next we need to train our model. Back to our examples of cats and dogs,  we can ask our model is this a cat or is this a dog and our model  will make a prediction, now the prediction is not always accurate in fact when you start out, it's very likely your predictions are inaccurate. Our model will then look for the patterns in the data, so enxt we can ask it to make predictions. Next we'll look at the libraries and tools for machine learning. So each algorithm has parameters that we can modify to optimize the accuracy. A very, very, popular library. The seconnd one is pandas, which is a data analysis library that provides a concept called data frame. In this lecture we're going too look at the popular python library that we use in machine learning projects. Now to install jupiter, we are going to use  platform called anaconda. ne learning  and data science projects. If you're working with a table of 10 or 20 columns  visualizing this data in a terminal window is really, really difficult and messy, so thats why we use jupiter. So that's why we use jupiter, it makes it really easy to inspect our data. Now, when working with machine learning  projects, we use an environment called jupiter for writing our code, technically we can still use vs code or any other code editor, but these editors  are not ideal for machine learning projects, because we need to frequently  inspect the data, and that is really hard in environments like vs code and  terminal. On this page you can download Anaconda distribution for your operating system,  so, we have distributions for Windows Mac and Linux. Alright now as part of the next step Anaconda is suggesting to install Microsoft vs code.   So, head over to Anaconda.com/download. So let's go ahead and install  Anaconda for python 3.7. Download,  Alright, so here's Anaconda, download it on my machine, let's double click this. Alright, now open upa  terminal window and type  jupiter, with a y, space, notebook. So every user on your machine has a home directory, this its my home directory  on Mac, you can see here we have a desktop folder as well as documents,  downloads and so on. On this dashboard we have a few tabs, the first tab is the files tab, and by default, this points to your home directory. This will start the notebook server  on your machine, we can see these default messages here, don't worry about them, now  it automatically opens a browser window, pointing to local host  port 888. This will start the notebook server on your machine. I'm going to go to desktop here's my desktop I don't have anything here, and then click new, I want to create a notebook for python  3. So,  let's go ahead with this,  alright, here's our first notebook, you can see by default it's called untitled, let's change that to Hello World so this is going to be the hello world of our machine learning project. r notebook. This is a jupiter  notebook. So back to our notebook, let's do a print hello world. So,  here in this list you can see the first item with this kind of reddish  icon, so, let's go with that, as you can see this data set includes the sales data for more then 16,000 videos  games. On this page you can see the description of various  columns in this data set, we have rank, name, platform,  year, and so on, so here's our data source, it's a csv file called vg sales.csv, as you can see ther Next I'm going to show you how to load a data set from a  csv file in jupiter. This is the name of a very popular data set that we're going to use in this lecture. Alright, in this lecture we're going to download a data set from a very popular website called caggle.com. e are over 16,000 rows, and 11 columns in this data set. With that, we go back  to our jupiter notebook, let's remove the first line and instead  import pandas  as pd. So this will give you a zip file as you can see here,  here's our csv file, now I want you to  put this right next to your jupiter notebook, on my machine that is on my desktop so I'm going to drag and drop this onto the desktop folder. Right below that you can see the first few records of this data set. Now, if you look at the desktop you can see here's my  jupiter, hello world notebook, and right next to that we have  vgsales.csv. So one more time let's run this program  here's our data frame with these rows and these columns so we have frank name platform and so on. csv. Let me show you. Now let's type pd. And pass the  name of our csv file. Now, we can see here we have another  segment for writing code. So here's our first segment, here we have these three lines, and this is the output of the last line. SO we don't have to write all the code in the first segment  so here in the second segment we can call one of the methods of the dataframe, that is df.describe. Below that we have our second segment, here we're calling the describe method, and right below that we have the output of this segment So this is the beauty of jupiter, you can easily visualize  our datsa, doing this with vscode in windows is really tedious and clunky. Now when we run this program, we can see the output for each segment right next to it. u saw earlier we have columns like rank, year and so  on. Now for each column we have  the count which is the number of records in that column, you can se  our rank column has 16,5 -98 records whereas the year column has 16,3- -27 records.. Now another attribute for each column  is mean so this is the average of all the values, now in the case of the rank column, this rank doesn't really matter, but look at the year. One option is to remove the records  that don't have a value for the year column. So this shows that some of our records don't  have the value for the year column. Let me show you another useful attribute. Let's run this, as you can see this returns  a two dimensional array, this square bracket indicates the outer array and a second one represents an inner array. So the first element inn our outer array, is an  array itself, these are the values in this array, which basically  represent the first row in our data set. In this lecture I'm going to show to you some of the most useful shortcuts in Jupiter So this was a basic  overview of pandas data frames, in the next lecture I'm going to show you some of the useful shortcuts of jupiter. For example, we have this command, o Depending  on the mode, we have different shortcuts, so here we're in the command mode. Now, if we press the  escape key, green turns to blue, and that means this cell is currently in the command mode. So here we have all  the commmands when a cell is in the command mode. So basically the activated cell can either  be in the edit mode or command mode. We can insert an empty cell above this cell by pressing a. This is exactly like the command palette that we have in vs code. Now in the cell I'm going to print a hello world message. We can also go  back to our first cell, press escape, now the cell is in the command  mode. I'm going to close this, now with our first cell in the command mode  I'm going to press b, and this inserts, a new  cell below this cell. So we can see hello world  is displayed here, but the cell below is still displaying  the describe table, so we don't see the changes here. Now,  to solve this problem, we can go to the cell menu on the top,  and run all cells together. Let me show you want I mean, so in the cell below the cell, I'm going to delete the call  to a describe method. But note that when you run  a cell, this will only execute the code in that cell. Now, I'm going  to put the cursor back in this cell where we print this hello world message and run this cell.  to rerun that code if it hasn't changed. So here in front of  so here in front of signature you can see the describe method, these are the paramter and their default value, and right below that you can see the description of what that method does. That is why it's different  from a regular py file where we only have the source code. So this notebook file that we have here,  includes our source code organized in cells as  well as the output for each cell. So let's call  describe, now with the cursor on the name of the method we can press shift and tab, to see this tool tip that describes what this method does and what parameter it takes. Over the next few lectures, we're going to work on a  real machine learning project,  imagine we have an online music store, when our users sign up,  we asked our age and gen Like this. Now, the next cell is activated and is in the command mode. So, let's delete this as well, so we have two more cells to delete  there you go, and the last one, like this,  so now we have an empty notebook with a single cell. Now over the next few lectures we're going to work on a real machine learning project, but before we get there,  let's delete all the cells here, so we start with only a single  empty cell, so here, in this cell, first I'm going to press the escape button, now the cell is blue, so we're in the command mode, and  we can delete the cell by pressing d twice. der, and based on their profile,  you recommend various music albums their likely to buy. So in this project,  you want to use machine learning to increase sales. Our model will learn the patterns in our data,  so we can ask it to make predictions. So, we want to build a model, we feed this model with some sample data,  based on the existing users. When a new user signs up,  we tell our model, hey, we have a new user with this profile, what  is the kind of music, that this user is interested in, our model will say jazz, or hip hop,  or whatever, and baed on that we can make suggestions to the user so, this is the problem we're going to solve, now back to the list of steps in the machine  learning projects, first we need to import our data, then, we should prepare or clean it, next we select a machine learning algorithm  to build a model, we treat our model and ask it to make predictions. Head over to bit.ly/music.csv this is a very basic csv that I've created for this project, it's just some random made up data it's not real. In my downloads folder, here we have this music.csv. Once again this is a made up pattern, it's not the representation of the reality, so,  let's go ahead and download this csv. I'm assuming that men between 20 and 25 like hip hop men between  26 and 30 like jazz, and after the age of 30,  they like classical music. For women I'm assuming  that if they are between 20 and 25 they like dance music, if they are between 26 and 30 they like acoustic music, and just like men, after the age of 30 they like classical music. Now let's inspect  this music_data to make sure we loaded everything properly so run, so here's our data frame, beautiful, next we need to prepare or clean the data. So I want you to put this csv file  right next to your jupiter notebook. Now, back to our notebook, you need to read the csv file, so just like before  first we need to import the pandas module, so import panda  as pd. And that's the topic for the next lecture. next lecture. The output set which is in this case  the genre column contains the predictions so we're telling our model that if we have a user who's 20 years old and a male they like  hip hop. As you can see in our input set, we don't have  a sample for a 21 year old male, so we're going to ask  our model to predict that. But there is one thing we need to do,  we should split this data set into two separate data sets, one into the first two columns, which we refer to as the input set, and the other  with the last column which we refer to as the output set. The input set and the output set. Once we train our model then we give it a new input set. Now, let's inspect x,  so as you can see our input set or x  includes these two columns, age and gender, it doesn't have the  output or predictions. In fact it will create a new data set but without thisq call. Input and output  So back to our code, this data frame object has a  method called drop. Next we need to create our output set so,  once again we start with ou Witht his parter we can specify the columns we want to drop, so in this case we set columns  to an array with one string, genre  now this method doesn't actually modify the original data set. In this lecture we're going to use a very simple algorithm called decision tree. Once again this returns  a new data set. So,  in this data set we only have the predictions or the answers. r data frame using data, using square brackets we can get all the  values in a given column. So we have prepared our data, next we want to create a model using an  algorithm. That is music data. Now before we do that, let's temporarily inspect our initial data set. You call model, .fit this method takes  2 data set. So, at the end, let's create  an object called models nd set it to anew instance of decision,  tree classifier. And in this module we have a class called decision tree classifier. Similarly,  I've assumed that women between 20 and 25 like dance music,  but we don' have a sample for a 22 year old female. We don't have a sample for  a 21 year old male. So once again if you ask our model to predict the kind of music that a 22 year old woman  likes, we expect it to say dance. a 21 year old male. So if you ask our model to predict the kind of music  that a 21 year old male likes, we expect it to say hip hop. ma 0, so we're asking our model to make 2 predictions  at the same time. So our model successfully  will make predictions here. In this lecture I'm going to show you how to measure the accuracy of your models. After we build a model we need to measure it's accuracy. So next lecture I'm going to show you how to measure the accuracy of a model. So training and testing,  now, right here, after we define x and y,  sets, we call this funciton, so train  test split. So first on this top from sklearn.model underline selection module we import a function called  train test split. With this function we can easily split our data set into two sets. So test _size we set it to 0.2 In the test set. x_train x_test y_train and y _test. so the first two variables  are the input sets for training and testing. To calculate the accuracy we simply have to compare these predictions  with the actual values we have in the output set  for testing. And the other are the output sets for training and testing,  now, when training our model,  instead of passing the entire data set we want to pass only the training data set. That contains input values for testing. Let me show you. So let's go ahead  and run this program. So, the accuracy score  is 1 or a 100% but if we run this one more time, we're going to see a different result because every time we split our data set into  training a test sets. So if I go to this second cell press the skip button, now we are in the command mode,  press d twice, okay now it's deleted, if we  click the run button, we can see, this code was  executed, and now we have a new cell, so if you want to run our cell multiple times  every time Let me show you, so put the cursor  in the cell, now we can see this is activated  note that if you click this button here, it will run the cell and also insert a new  cell below this cell. you have to click this and then run it, and then click again, and run it, it's a little bit tedious. So, back here, lets run it multiple times  okay, now look the accuracy dropped to 0.75, it's  still good, so the cuuracey scored here, is somewhere  between 75% to a hundred %. 8, so essentially we're using only 20 percent of our data,  for training this model. The reason this is happening is because you are using very little data for training this model. Now let's see what happens when we run this cell multiple times. For example, here we're only dealing with a table of three  columns, but if you want to build a model to tell if a picture of a cat or a dog or a horse,  or a lion, we will need millions of pictures, the more animal  it will support the more pictures we need. So this is a  very basic implementation of building a training a model to make a That's why it's really important to clean  before training our model. Some machine learning problems, require, thousands or even millions  of samples, to train model, the more complex a problem is,  the more data we need. r model and the cleaner the data is, we get the better result, so if you have duplicates,  irrelevant data, or incomplete values, our model will learn back patterns in our data. Now to simplify things I have removed all the code that you wrote in the last lecture for calculating the accuracy, because in this lecture, you're going to focus on a different topic, So basically we import our data set. In this example, we're dealing with a  very small data set that only has 20 records. And that is wy model persistence is important, once in a while,  you build and train our model and then we save it to a file. Create a  model, train it, and then  ask it to make predictions, now this piece of code that you see here, is not what we want to run everytime we have a new user or every time we want to make recommendations to an existing user sometimes it's really time consuming. Now, next time we want to make predictions, we simply load the model from the file and  ask it to make predictions. Now temporarily I'm going to comment  out this line, we don't want to make any predictions, we just want to store train model in a file. Let's call this music  -recommender.job lib  That's all we have to do. Now back to our  desktop, right next to my notebook we can see our job lib file, this is where our model is stored. Our model and the name of the file  in which we want to store this model. So,  after we train our model we'll simply call job lib .dump and give it  two arguments. Let me show you. k. As I told you before in a real application we don't want to train model every time. In this lecture, we're going to  export our model in visual format, so you will see  how this model makes predictions, that is really, really cool. Okay, these lines are commented out, now this time, instead of dumping  our model, we're going to load it, so we call the load method, we don't have the model, we simply  pass the name of our model file. let's print predictions and see if our model is behaving  so control  so this is how we persist and load models. So,  the parameter we're going to set it out_file  let's set this to music-recommend  .dot. n I've simplified this code so we simply import our data set, create  input and output sets, create a model, and  train it, that's all we are doing, now I want you to follow along with me, type everything exactly as I show you in this lecture. So on the top, from sklearnimport tree, this object has a method for exporting our decision tree in a  graphical format. So here we're going to use keyword  arguments, because this method takes so many parameters, and we want to selectively pass  keyword arguments without worrying about their order. So after we  train our model, let's call tree  _graph vis. Now the other parameter you want to set is feature  _names. So they are properties or features of our data. So class_names  we should set this to the list of classes or labels we have in our output data set, like hip hop, jazz, classical and so on. So, this y data set includes all the genre or all the classes of our data, but they are repeated a few times in this data set. These are the features  or the columns of our data set. graphvis or .language by stephon vs. Go ahead and install this extension  and then reload vs code. Once you do that, you can visualize  this dot file. So like that alright, here's the visualization of our decision tree,  let's close the dot file, there you go. So we want to open this file with vs code. Okay, here's a dot format, it's a textural language for describing graphs  Now to visualize this graph we need to install an extension in vs code. That means that user is younger then  30, so, now we check the gender, if it's less then 0.5,  which basically means it equals to 0, then  we're dealing with a female. Now what if this condition  is true. If this condition is false, that means that user is 30 years  or older, so the genre of the music that their interested in is classical. n. On top of each note we have a condition  if this condition is true we go to the child node on the left side. So we go to the child node here,  now once again we have another condition, so we are dealing with a female  who is younger than 30. We set  rounded to true, so they have rounded corners. We set label to all so every node has labels that we can read. Now back to our code  let me quickly explain the meaning of all these parameters, we set field to true  so each box or each node is filled with a color. So they are not always the same, also the more columns or the more features  we have, our decision tree is going to get more complex. So this is a decision tree that our model uses to make predictions  Now if you're wondering why we have these floating point numbers like 25.5 These are basically the rules  that our model generates, based on the patterns in our dataset. Now you can use the materials that you learn in this section  and apply them to solve a different set of problems. Now here's a question for you:  What ideas do you have for machine learning? What kind of problems do you want to solve  with machine learning? Are you ready, let's get started In this turorial, I'm going to show you how to create your first website with python, and A  and a very popular framework called django. Next we're going to use python and a popular framework called django. Now technically a framework is more then a library,  apart from providing these modules it also provides a structure for each application  It tells us what folders or files we should have in our project. So this provides a consistency among various django projects. Well, the framework is essentially a library of reusable modules these modules provide functionality for common tasks  for example, in the case of a web framework like django we have modules to work with http requests  url's, sessions, cookies and so on. So all this functionality is baked into django, we don't have to code it from scratch, that is why we use a framework like django. Now,  django. So back to pycharm, close the hello world  project, and create a new project, create a new project,  let's call this new project pyshop go ahead, alright, now down at the bottom let's  open up a terminal window, in this window we're going to install django. So we use pip to install  django. rom one company to another and work on different projects, you can easily transition from one project to another, because all these applications follow the same structure now, with that interaction, let's create our first  django project. I  want to make sure that you can easily follow these tutorials, even though what I'm going to show you  in these tutorials will most likely work with the latest version of django. But be sure to add two equal signs here followed by  2.1 With this we are telling pip that we want to install django version  2.1. So this period is imported here, that means the current folder, if you don't add this period, this utility is going to create an extra folder and that looks a little bit repetitive, so let's go ahead with this,  alright, now, back to the projec Now, this program takes various arguments, in this case  we want to use this argument start project, with this we're going to create a project called pushup in the current folder. So when we install django, django brings a  command line utility called django admin so this is a utility or program that we can execute form the command line or terminal, right here. So let's go ahead alright, django is installed,  next we need to create a django project, so here press control and L this cleans up our terminal window, you don't have to do it, but it's just easier to see. To create a django project, we need to execute this command, django,  -admin space  start project space, you're going to call this  project pyshop space period. The purpose of this module is to provide a standard interface between applications built with django and web servers. And finally we have this module, that wsgi, that is short for web server gateway interface. t panel, if you expand py shop we can see that this is our project that we created in pycharm  and in this folder we have these files. So, init.py, you have seen this before, that means  this folder is package, so we can import various modules,  of this package into other modules, and in this module,  we define various settings for our application, you're going to see this later in this course. Now, outside of this folder,  of this folder you also have this new folder in our project  manage.py. So python 3 space manage  .py space run  server. This manage.py is essentially the same program  that we worked with here, django admin. With this we can start our web server,   we can work with our data base, again, we're going to work with this soon,  let's open up the terminal window one more time, now,  type out this command, python if you're on windows or python  3 if you're on Mac, because as I told you at the beginning of the course, Mac by  default comes with an installation of python, that is python 2. So with python interpreter  we are running this program manage.py and passing run server  as an argument. But we use django admin before creating a django project, now we have a django project, so now  in this project we work with manage.py this is a module that contains some python code, so we use this module to manage  our django project.\n","\n","Abstractive Summary:\n","In this course I'm going to teach you everything  you need to get started with Python.

He also teaches beginners how to create a website in Python using a popular framework.\n00:05:00 In this Python tutorial, we will learn how to write basic Python code and see its results. We will also learn about some programming terms and how Python code gets executed.\n00:10:00 In this Python tutorial, you'll learn about variables and how to use them to store data in a computer's memory. You'll also learn how to print out the value of a variable.\n00:15:00 In this Python tutorial, you will learn how to use the input and print functions to receive user input and print messages.\n00:20:00 This video covers the basics of Python programming, with examples of code that performs simple tasks. The video provides instructions on how to write a program that asks the user their birth year and calculates their age. When the user enters an invalid year, an error is generated and the user is directed to the appropriate line in the source code.\n00:25:00 In this tutorial, you're going to learn about Python strings and how to use various string functions. You'll also learn how to convert strings into integers and floats, and how to use the input function to get user input. Finally, you'll see how to use the type function to determine the type of a variable.\n00:30:00 This tutorial explains how to use double and single quotes to define strings in Python. It also covers how to use triple quotes to create strings that span multiple lines. Finally, it demonstrates how to use the indexing syntax to get a specific character from a string.\n00:35:00 In this Python tutorial, we look at how to format strings for easy viewing. We define a variable msg to hold a formatted string, and then use that string to print messages on the terminal. However, this approach becomes more complex as our text becomes more complex. For more concise and easy-to-read code, we use formatted strings.\n00:40:00 In this Python tutorial, the instructor covers how to use functions and methods to manipulate strings. He shows how to use the len and upper methods to calculate the number of characters in a string, and how to use the find method to find a specific character in a string.\n00:45:00 In this Python tutorial, you learned about the arithmetic operators supported in the language. You also learned about the in operator, which produces a boolean value. You also learned about the find and replace methods, and the len function.\n00:50:00 In this Python tutorial, you learned about the arithmetic operators and how to use the augmented assignment operator. You also learned about operator precedence and how it affects the order of operations. Finally, you were asked to solve a math problem and you correctly guessed that x would be 22 after the code was executed.\n00:55:00 In this tutorial, we'll learn about the if statement in Python. We'll see how to write a program that makes decisions based on a condition, and then print out the results."}},"55cfba55b6314a419a766462b7a2650a":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","model_name":"LayoutModel","model_module_version":"1.2.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_model_module_version":"1.2.0","_model_name":"LayoutModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"LayoutView","align_content":null,"align_items":null,"align_self":null,"border":null,"bottom":null,"display":null,"flex":null,"flex_flow":null,"grid_area":null,"grid_auto_columns":null,"grid_auto_flow":null,"grid_auto_rows":null,"grid_column":null,"grid_gap":null,"grid_row":null,"grid_template_areas":null,"grid_template_columns":null,"grid_template_rows":null,"height":"100px","justify_content":null,"justify_items":null,"left":null,"margin":null,"max_height":null,"max_width":null,"min_height":null,"min_width":null,"object_fit":null,"object_position":null,"order":null,"overflow":null,"overflow_x":null,"overflow_y":null,"padding":null,"right":null,"top":null,"visibility":null,"width":"100%"}},"564d45bd98514981a35f9a905733fe9d":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"DescriptionStyleModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"DescriptionStyleModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"StyleView","description_width":""}},"93c414c4247f41dca6b58cdaaaf29411":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"ButtonModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"ButtonModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"ButtonView","button_style":"","description":"Summarize","disabled":false,"icon":"","layout":"IPY_MODEL_ff4846a96747408a8ec8f137edd8ca38","style":"IPY_MODEL_3b4054609e9349289432723af28d3b1d","tooltip":""}},"ff4846a96747408a8ec8f137edd8ca38":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","model_name":"LayoutModel","model_module_version":"1.2.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_model_module_version":"1.2.0","_model_name":"LayoutModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"LayoutView","align_content":null,"align_items":null,"align_self":null,"border":null,"bottom":null,"display":null,"flex":null,"flex_flow":null,"grid_area":null,"grid_auto_columns":null,"grid_auto_flow":null,"grid_auto_rows":null,"grid_column":null,"grid_gap":null,"grid_row":null,"grid_template_areas":null,"grid_template_columns":null,"grid_template_rows":null,"height":null,"justify_content":null,"justify_items":null,"left":null,"margin":null,"max_height":null,"max_width":null,"min_height":null,"min_width":null,"object_fit":null,"object_position":null,"order":null,"overflow":null,"overflow_x":null,"overflow_y":null,"padding":null,"right":null,"top":null,"visibility":null,"width":null}},"3b4054609e9349289432723af28d3b1d":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"ButtonStyleModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"ButtonStyleModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/base","_view_module_version":"1.2.0","_view_name":"StyleView","button_color":null,"font_weight":""}},"d697f2acfa4e42cfa90d43f2ed82213e":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"HBoxModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"HBoxModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"HBoxView","box_style":"","children":["IPY_MODEL_a308af92de1c42318a826b9675a606ed","IPY_MODEL_74bc4304e62c4151b2b8c828ceedc4db","IPY_MODEL_3f9faa55afd3413b96a39f4a3e0ff30b"],"layout":"IPY_MODEL_e758e899e6c244e0ac50582164b65a8f"}},"a308af92de1c42318a826b9675a606ed":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"HTMLModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"HTMLModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_view_module_version":"1.5.0","_view_name":"HTMLView","description":"","description_tooltip":null,"layout":"IPY_MODEL_e05c906ffe964d319f57b908c9294899","placeholder":"​","style":"IPY_MODEL_59838dbedc884fa99382e6ba67dffadc","value":"vocab.json: 100%"}},"74bc4304e62c4151b2b8c828ceedc4db":{"model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","model_name":"FloatProgressModel","model_module_version":"1.5.0","state":{"_dom_classes":[],"_model_module":"@jupyter-widgets/controls","_model_module_version":"1.5.0","_model_name":"FloatProgressModel","_view_count":null,"_view_module":"@jupyter-
